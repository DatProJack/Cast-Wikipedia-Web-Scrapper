Guardians of the Galaxy,2,Chris Pratt,Peter Quill / Star-Lord:The half-human," half-alien leader of the Guardians who was abducted from Missouri as a child in 1988 and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers. About the character, Pratt said, ""He had a hard time as a kid, and now he goes around space, making out with hot alien girls and just being a rogue and a bit of a jerk, and through teaming up with these guys, finds a higher purpose for himself."" He also added that the character is a mix of Han Solo and Marty McFly. Pratt, who was mostly known for playing supporting characters, including Andy Dwyer on the television series Parks and Recreation, initially turned down the role. Pratt had lost weight to portray fit characters in films such as Moneyball and Zero Dark Thirty, and had given up ambitions to play the lead role in action films after humbling auditions for Star Trek and Avatar. Casting director Sarah Finn suggested Pratt to Gunn, who dismissed the idea despite struggling to cast that role. Despite this, Finn arranged for a meeting between the two, at which point Gunn was immediately convinced that Pratt was perfect for the role. Pratt also won over Feige, despite having gained weight again for Delivery Man. Prior to filming, Pratt underwent a strict diet and training regimen to lose 60 pounds  in six months. Pratt signed a multi-film contract with Marvel, and was granted a temporary leave from his work on Parks and Recreation to accommodate his participation in the film. Wyatt Oleff portrays a young Quill."
Guardians of the Galaxy,3,Zoe Saldaña,Gamora:An orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes. She was trained by Thanos to be his personal assassin. Saldaña said that she became Gamora through make-up rather than computer-generated imagery  or performance capture. On taking the role," Saldaña said, ""I was just excited to be asked to join by James Gunn and to also play someone green. I've been blue before ."" Saldaña described Gamora as ""... a warrior, she's an assassin and she's very lethal, but what saves her is the same thing that can doom her. She has a sense of righteousness. She's a very righteous individual."""
Guardians of the Galaxy,4,Dave Bautista,Drax the Destroyer:A warrior who seeks to avenge his family's death at the hands of Ronan. On relating to the character," Bautista said, ""I can just relate to Drax so much it's not even funny. Just the simple things that we have in common. Simple things like the tattoos, the tragedy—because, you know, I had a bit of tragedy in my life, as well. So it's really easy for me to pull from that."" Bautista also said that there was ""a lot of comic relief to Drax"", but the character was not aware of it. Bautista stated that he did not do much preparation for the role, because ""Luckily, for me, I'm a lifelong athlete and I adapted real quick."" Bautista's makeup took approximately four hours to apply, though it could be removed in just 90 minutes. Drax has various scarring patterns on his body, which replace the simple tattoos from the comics, each having a specific story. Additionally, his skin tone was changed from the bright green in the comics to a muddier grey, to avoid visual similarities to the Hulk."
Guardians of the Galaxy,5,Vin Diesel,Groot:A tree-like humanoid," he is the accomplice of Rocket. Diesel stated that he provided the voice and motion capture for Groot, after originally being in talks to star in a new Phase Three Marvel film. Diesel also provided Groot's voice for several foreign-language releases of the film. Krystian Godlewski portrayed the character on set, though his acting was not used in the final character CGI. On the character, which Gunn based on his dog, Gunn said, ""All the Guardians start out the movie as bastards—except Groot. He's an innocent. He's a hundred percent deadly and a hundred percent sweet. He's caught up in Rocket's life, really."" Gunn added that the design and movement of Groot took ""the better part of a year"" to create. Gunn added, ""The ways in which Vin Diesel says, 'I am Groot,' I am astounded. All of the 'I am Groots' that were earlier voices didn't sound very good at all ... Vin came in and in one day, laid down all these 'I am Groot' tracks, and he's a perfectionist. He made me explain to him with ever   'I am Groot,' exactly what he was saying ... It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how much the character changed and how much he influenced the character."" Regarding the limited words used by Groot, Diesel said in many ways this was, ""... the most challenging thing to ask an actor to do."" Diesel found an emotional note in his performance, invoking the death of his friend and Fast & Furious co-star Paul Walker, saying, ""This was in December , and the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death, so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice."" Groot's form and size-changing abilities are seen, with Gunn stating that he has the ability to grow in the film."
Guardians of the Galaxy,6,Bradley Cooper,Rocket:A genetically-engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter," mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics. Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was ""not a cartoon character"", saying, ""It's not Bugs Bunny in the middle of the Avengers, it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean-ass fighting machine."" Gunn also based the character on himself. Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, ""I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas guy."" Cooper voiced Rocket, while Sean Gunn  stood in for the character during filming. James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movements from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, were recorded as potential references for the animators, though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film. Sean noted they ""kind of stumbled"" into the process of him performing on set since they ""weren't sure how we were going to create that character"". The same process continued to be used for all subsequent appearances of Rocket. Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone who could balance ""the fast-talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny. But also has the heart that Rocket has. Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes with Rocket."""
Guardians of the Galaxy,7,Lee Pace,Ronan the Accuser:A Kree zealot and war criminal who agrees to retrieve an artifact for Thanos in exchange for the annihilation of his mortal enemies," the Xandarians. Ronan and his Sakaaran army hunt down the Guardians when they interfere with his goals. Describing Ronan, Gunn said, ""He is the primary villain, and he is a really twisted guy, he has a really religious bent in this film. He has a very sick and twisted view of what morality is; strength is virtue and weakness is sin and that is what he lives by, and I think he is very scary because of his beliefs, which are real to him."" Pace, who originally auditioned for Peter Quill, described Ronan as a ""psycho"" and a ""monster""."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8,Michael Rooker,Yondu Udonta:A blue-skinned bandit who is the leader of the Ravagers and a paternal figure to Quill. Yondu helps Quill to steal the orb before Quill betrays him," leaving Yondu and the Ravagers to chase the Guardians. On the character, Rooker said, he has ""some interesting issues—not a good guy, not a bad guy. There's hope and there's a heart inside Yondu."" Gunn created the film's version of the character specifically with Rooker in mind, while borrowing the character's mohawk and use of a whistle-controlled arrow from the comics. Rooker fully committed to the role once he knew his role on the TV series The Walking Dead would be ending. Rooker's makeup took approximately four hours to apply."
Guardians of the Galaxy,9,Karen Gillan,Nebula:An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings and is a loyal lieutenant in the employ of Ronan and Thanos. About the character," Gillan said, ""She is the female villain of the film ... She is very sadistic and evil, but I like to think for a very valid reason."" She also added, ""I think she's a really interesting character. What I like to play around with is how jealous she is. She's Gamora's sister, and there's a lot of sibling rivalry. That's the most interesting aspect to me, because jealousy can consume you and turn you bitter, and ugly. And she's a total sadist, so that's fun too."" Gillan researched the ancient Spartans, shaved off her hair, and trained for two months for the role. The character's makeup took approximately four-and-a-half hours to be applied."
Guardians of the Galaxy,10,Djimon Hounsou,Korath:A Kree ally of Ronan who is a feared intergalactic hunter. As to why he took the role," Hounsou said, ""I have a four-year old son who loves superheroes from Spider-Man to Iron Man to Batman. He's got all the costumes. One day he looks at me and says 'Dad, I want to be light-skinned so I could be Spider-Man. Spider-Man has light skin.' That was sort of a shock. This is why I am excited to be a part of the Marvel Universe, so I could hopefully provide that diversity in the role of the superhero."""
Guardians of the Galaxy,11,John C. Reilly,Rhomann Dey: A corpsman in the Nova Corps, the Nova Empire's military and police force.
Guardians of the Galaxy,12,Glenn Close,Irani Rael:The leader of the Nova Corps," known as Nova Prime, whose mission is to protect the citizens of the Nova Empire and keep peace. Close stated that she ""had always wanted to be in a movie like this"", and that it would be ""the most fun to play something like the Judi Dench  or Samuel L. Jackson  role"". She said that she took the role because she ""love to do stuff that's different"" and wanted to show that she "" always been up for anything."" She also stated that her contract has ""several"" films on it, and that she would be open to working on other Marvel Studios films in addition to returning for Guardians sequels."
Guardians of the Galaxy,13,Benicio del Toro,Taneleer Tivan / The Collector:An obsessive keeper of the largest collection of interstellar fauna," relics, and species in the galaxy who operates out of a place in space named Knowhere. Describing del Toro's performance, Gunn said, ""He's like an outer-space Liberace. That's what it says in the script, which he's kind of doing."" On bringing the character to life, del Toro said, ""What James  wanted, that I found out little by little as I was doing it, is that he wanted me to explore and just keep pushing the character and keep creating  as I was in front of the camera."""

The Avengers,2,Robert Downey Jr.,Tony Stark / Iron Man: A self-described genius," billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with an electromechanical suit of armor of his own invention. Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which included Iron Man 2  and The Avengers. He said he initially pushed Whedon to make Stark the lead: ""Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus."" About the character's evolution from previous films, Downey said, ""In Iron Man, which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. Iron Man 2 is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In The Avengers, he's throwing it down with the others"". Downey earned $50 million from the film, ""once box-office bonuses and backend compensation  factored in""."
The Avengers,3,Chris Evans,Steve Rogers / Captain America: A World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films," in addition to The Avengers. Evans said that Steve Rogers is much darker in The Avengers: ""It's just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You've got to imagine, it's enough of a shock to accept the fact that you're in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about. . . He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they're all dead. He's just lonely. I think in the beginning it's a fish-out-of-water scene, and it's tough. It's a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world."" Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, Evans said, ""I think there's certainly a dichotomy—this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they're polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it's pretty fun."" Evans earned $2–3 million for the film."
The Avengers,4,Mark Ruffalo,Bruce Banner / Hulk: A genius scientist who," because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Ruffalo, who was considered to play Banner in The Incredible Hulk  before Edward Norton took the role, was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton broke down. About replacing Norton, Ruffalo said, ""I'm a friend of Ed's, and yeah, that wasn't a great way for all that to go down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I look at it as my generation's Hamlet."" About the character, he said, ""He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself—the dark and the light—and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities"". Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, ""He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!"" This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told New York magazine, ""I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the Avatar stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun"". The 3D model used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after Long Island bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo. To create the Hulk's voice, Ruffalo's voice was blended with those of Lou Ferrigno and others; however, the Hulk's only speaking line  was provided solely by Ruffalo. Ruffalo earned $2–3 million for the film."
The Avengers,5,Chris Hemsworth,Thor: The crown prince of Asgard," based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal. He had previously worked with Joss Whedon on The Cabin in the Woods . Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for Thor  by increasing his food intake, consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how much, Hemsworth said, ""My body weight in protein pretty much!"" He remarked that Thor's motivation ""is much more of a personal one, in the sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone else, it's some bad guy who they've gotta take down. It's a different approach for me, or for Thor. He's constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . . I've been frustrated with my brothers at times, or family, but I'm the only one who is allowed to be angry at them. There's a bit of that."" Hemsworth earned $2–3 million for the film."
The Avengers,6,Scarlett Johansson,Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: A highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D. About the character and her relationship with Hawkeye," Johansson said, ""Our characters have a long history. They've fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries. We're the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors – we have no superpowers. Black Widow is definitely one of the team, though. She's not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy. She's there to fight, so I never felt like I was the only girl. We all have our various skills and it feels equal"". Regarding her training, Johansson said, ""Even though Iron Man 2 was 'one-for-them,' I'd never done anything like that before. I'd never been physically driven in something, or a part of something so big. For The Avengers, I've spent so many months training with our stunt team, and fighting all the other actors, it's crazy. I do nothing but fight—all the time."" Johansson earned $4–6 million for the film."
The Avengers,7,Jeremy Renner,Clint Barton / Hawkeye: A master archer working as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. Renner said it was a very physical role and that he trained physically and practiced archery as much as possible in preparation. About the role," Renner said, ""When I saw Iron Man, I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes. Then they told me about this Hawkeye character, and I liked how he wasn't really a superhero; he's just a guy with a high skill set. I could connect to that."" Regarding Hawkeye's sniper mentality, Renner said, ""It's a lonely game. He's an outcast. His only connection is to Scarlett's character, Natasha. It's like a left hand/right hand thing. They coexist, and you need them both, especially when it comes to a physical mission."" Renner said Hawkeye is not insecure about his humanity. ""Quite the opposite, he's the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his  arrows. He knows his limitations. But when it comes down to it, there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero."" Renner earned $2–3 million for the film."
The Avengers,8,Tom Hiddleston,Loki: Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis," based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. About his character's evolution from the film Thor, Hiddleston said, ""I think the Loki we see in The Avengers is further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making? So I think by the time Loki shows up in The Avengers, he's seen a few things."" About Loki's motivations, Hiddleston said, ""At the beginning of The Avengers, he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king. And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant. But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect, so I haven't let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation."""
The Avengers,9,Stellan Skarsgård,Erik Selvig: An astrophysicist and friend of Thor under Loki's control who is studying the Tesseract's power. Regarding Loki's control over Selvig," Skarsgård said, ""Well with the scene we did in Thor, it was like Loki, one way or the other, entered Erik's mind. And in Avengers, you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Erik's mind."" About his role, he said, "" is of importance but the size of the role is not big."""
The Avengers,10,Samuel L. Jackson,"Nick Fury: The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the ""Avengers Initiative"". Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films. Jackson said he does more in The Avengers than in any of the previous films: ""You don't have to wait until the end of the movie to see me"". About the role"," Jackson said, ""It's always good to play somebody  is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem."" Jackson compared the character to Ordell Robbie in Jackie Brown, calling him ""a nice guy to hang out with. You just don't want to cross him"". Jackson earned $4–6 million for the film."

Deadpool,2,Ryan Reynolds,Wade Wilson / Deadpool is a wisecracking mutant mercenary with accelerated healing," but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental cancer treatment. The writers described Deadpool as ""fun to hang out with... in short doses"". Reynolds promised a more ""authentic"" and comic-faithful version of the character than the one he portrayed in X-Men Origins: Wolverine . The character becomes aware he is in a film after becoming Deadpool, though before this, Wilson does make a joke about Reynolds' role in Green Lantern ."
Deadpool,3,Morena Baccarin,"Vanessa is an escort and Wilson's fiancée. Baccarin described Vanessa as ""scrappy"" and not a damsel in distress. The character was initially designed as a ""typical prostitute"""," but Baccarin worked with the costume and makeup teams to make her appearance more layered. The film does not explore the character's comic alter ego Copycat, as the writers wanted to focus on Deadpool. Makeup designer Bill Corso, however, included some references to Copycat's blue appearance in the comics."
Deadpool,4,Ed Skrein,Francis Freeman / Ajax is the artificially mutated leader of the program that creates Deadpool. He is immune to pain and has enhanced strength and reflexes. Director Tim Miller praised Skrein's dedication to the role," saying, ""he worked really, really hard"" for the fight sequences and completed around 80% of his own stunts in the film. Skrein was influenced by Rutger Hauer's Roy Batty from Blade Runner , and serial killer Harold Shipman."
Deadpool,5,T.J. Miller,"Weasel is Wilson's best friend. Miller felt he was cast as the character because he ""looks like his superhero power is spilling mustard on his shirt"". Producer Simon Kinberg added that an actor was needed ""who could keep up with"" Reynolds comedically. Miller attempted to give the character a facial tic", but director Tim Miller rejected the idea.
Deadpool,6,Gina Carano,"Angel Dust is an artificially mutated member of the program that creates Deadpool. She uses her adrenaline as fuel to increase her strength and durability to superhuman levels. Director Miller personally called Carano and asked her to take the part. Carano felt the character's rage and ""extreme adrenaline issues"" made comparisons to the drug ""angel dust"" fitting. She had wanted to wear yellow contact lenses to match the character's look in the comics"," but Corso turned the idea down, comparing it to something from the Twilight films."
Deadpool,7,Brianna Hildebrand,"Negasonic Teenage Warhead is a teenaged X-Men trainee who can generate atomic bursts from her body. The filmmakers wanted to use the character based on her name and looked to change her comic abilities from telepathic and precognitive powers to ""a literal warhead"". They required permission from Marvel to do this", which Tim Miller obtained after talking with Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige. A deal was reached allowing the change in exchange for 20th Century Fox giving Marvel Studios the film rights to the character Ego the Living Planet for use in their film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 .

Iron Man,1,Directed by: Jon Favreau,"Screenplay by: Mark FergusHawk Ostby"","" Art MarcumMatt Holloway",Based on: Iron Manby Stan LeeLarry LieberDon HeckJack Kirby,"Produced by: Avi Arad"","" Kevin Feige","Starring: Robert Downey Jr."","" Terrence Howard"","" Jeff Bridges"","" Gwyneth Paltrow"","" Leslie Bibb"","" Shaun Toub",Cinematography: Matthew Libatique,Edited by: Dan Lebental,Music by: Ramin Djawadi,Productioncompany: Productioncompany,Distributed by: Paramount Pictures[a],Release dates: Release dates,Running time: Running time,Country: United States,Language: English,Budget: $140 million[2],Box office: $585.8 million[2]
Iron Man,2,Robert Downey Jr.,Tony Stark / Iron Man: An industrialist," genius inventor, and consummate playboy, he is CEO of Stark Industries and chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military. Director Jon Favreau felt that Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part and that the actor could not only make Stark a ""likable asshole,"" but also portray an authentic emotional journey, once he had won over the audience. Favreau was also attracted to Downey because of his performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Downey frequently spoke with that film's director, Shane Black, about the script and dialogue in Iron Man. Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process, especially when it came to adding humor to the film. Downey explained, ""What I usually hate about these  movies  when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into Dudley Do-Right, and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' That Eliot Ness-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable. When someone used to be a schmuck and they're not anymore, hopefully they still have a sense of humor."" To get into shape, Downey spent five days a week weight training and practiced martial arts, which he said benefited him because ""it's hard not to have a personality meltdown ... after about several hours in that suit. I'm calling up every therapeutic moment I can think of to just get through the day."""
Iron Man,3,Terrence Howard,"James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes: A friend of Stark's and the liaison between Stark Industries and the United States Air Force in the department of acquisitions"," specifically weapons development. Favreau cast Howard because he felt he could play War Machine in a sequel. Howard prepared for the role by visiting Nellis Air Force Base on March 16, 2007, where he ate with the pilots and observed HH-60 Pave Hawk rescue helicopters and F-22 Raptors. While Rhodes is roguish in the comics after he meets Stark, his previous role as a disciplinarian creates a dynamic tension with Stark's character. He is unsure whether Stark's actions are acceptable. ""Rhodey is completely disgusted with the way Tony has lived his life, but at a certain point he realizes that perhaps there is a different way,"" Howard said. ""Whose life is the right way: Is it the strict military life, or the life of an independent?"" Howard and his father are Iron Man fans, partly because Rhodes was one of the few black superheroes when Howard was a child. He has been a Downey fan since he saw him in Weird Science; the two competed physically on set."
Iron Man,4,Jeff Bridges,Obadiah Stane: Stark's business second-in-command," mentor, and friend, who turns on him to take over the company, eventually building a giant exosuit to fight Stark. Bridges read the comics as a boy and liked Favreau's modern, realistic approach. He shaved his head, something he had wanted to do for some time, and grew a beard for the role. Bridges researched the Book of Obadiah, and was surprised to learn retribution is a major theme in that book of the Bible, something that Stane represents. Many of Stane's scenes were cut to focus more on Stark, but the writers felt Bridges's performance allowed the application of ""less is more"" when editing the film."
Iron Man,5,Gwyneth Paltrow,"Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts: Stark's personal assistant and budding love interest. Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character"," whom she considered to be very smart, level-headed, and grounded. She said she liked ""the fact that there's a sexuality that's not blatant."" Favreau wanted Potts' and Stark's relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s comedy, something which Paltrow considered to be fun in an ""innocent yet sexy"" way."
Iron Man,6,Leslie Bibb,Christine Everhart: A reporter for Vanity Fair.,
Iron Man,7,Shaun Toub,Ho Yinsen: Stark's fellow captive," who grafts an electromagnet to Stark's chest ""to keep the shrapnel shell shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him"" and helps Stark build the first Iron Man suit."

Ant,2,Paul Rudd,Scott Lang / Ant-Man: A former systems engineer at VistaCorp and petty criminal who acquires a suit that allows him to shrink in size but increase in strength. Regarding Rudd's casting," producer Kevin Feige said, ""Look at that origin of the petty crook who comes into contact with a suit and does his best to make good, and then look at someone like Paul Rudd, who can do slightly unsavory things like break into people's houses and still be charming and who you root for and whose redemption you will find satisfaction in."" Director Peyton Reed compared Lang to George Clooney's character Danny Ocean from Ocean's Eleven, saying, ""He's a guy trying to create a new life for himself and find redemption."" To get in shape for the role, Rudd worked with trainers and cut alcohol, fried foods, and carbohydrates out of his diet. Rudd stated that in preparation for his role, he ""basically didn't eat anything for about a year ... I took the Chris Pratt approach to training for an action movie. Eliminate anything fun for a year and then you can play a hero."" Rudd signed a multi-film contract with Marvel, with Feige saying it was ""three -plus-plus to appear in other things."""
Ant,3,Evangeline Lilly,Hope van Dyne: The daughter of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne and senior board member of Pym Technologies who helps Darren Cross take over the company. Throughout the film," character progression brings Hope closer to becoming a hero. Lilly described her character as ""capable, strong, and kick-ass"", but said that being raised by two superheroes resulted in Hope being ""a pretty screwed up human being... and the clear message sent by my name is that I'm not a big fan of my father and so I took my mother's name."" She added that Van Dyne's ""arc in the movie is trying to find a relationship"" with Pym. Originally cast by Wright, Lilly was reluctant to take the role after he left the project until she read the revised script and got a chance to meet with Reed. Feige said that Van Dyne was the more obvious choice to take up the mantle of Ant-Man, being ""infinitely more capable of actually being a superhero"" than Lang, and that the reason she does not is because of Pym's experience with losing her mother, rather than sexism, which Feige felt would not be a problem for Pym in modern times. Lilly signed a multi-film contract with Marvel."
Ant,4,Corey Stoll,"Darren Cross / Yellowjacket: A former protégé of Pym's who takes over his mentor's company and militarizes a similar version of the Ant-Man technology to create the Yellowjacket suit. Stoll described the suit as ""the next generation of Ant-Man's suit"""," with a sleeker, more militaristic look as ""if Apple had designed a battle suit."" As for his character, Stoll said that Cross was more like Hank Pym than ""Thanos or Loki, who are villains that know it"", since Cross is a ""brilliant scientist, who is not ethically pure"" with shades of gray. Unlike Rudd, who wore a practical costume as Ant-Man, Stoll wore a motion capture suit while performing as Yellowjacket. Reed explained that this decision was made early on when creating and filming with a real Yellowjacket costume was found to be impractical."
Ant,5,Bobby Cannavale,Jim Paxton: A San Francisco Police Department officer who is engaged to Lang's former wife Maggie. Cannavale stated that Rudd and McKay convinced him to join the film during the rewriting process before Marvel approached him," saying, ""They sort of pumped  part up a bit...I really went on good faith  because they're so secretive  about the script. I just trusted them."" He also added that the process felt like an indie film instead of a large-scale blockbuster, and that he was able to improvise frequently along with the other actors. Patrick Wilson was originally cast in the role, before leaving the film because of scheduling conflicts brought on by the filming delay."
Ant,6,Michael Peña,"Luis: Lang's former cellmate and member of his crew. Peña stated that he modeled Luis' vocal style and positive outlook on life ""on a friend of a friend"""," saying, ""That's just the way he talks and the cadence. He's got this grin on the entire time and he doesn't care. He's the kind of guy where you're like 'Hey, what'd you do this weekend?' and he's like 'I went to jail, dawg,' with a smile on his face. Not a lot of people do that. Not a lot of people think of life on those terms."" Peña signed a contract with Marvel for three films."
Ant,7,"Tip ""T.I."" Harris","Dave: A member of Lang's crew. Harris described Dave as Lang's ""homeboy"". Harris also revealed that he was not permitted to read the entire script"," explaining ""You're just handed scenes as the film  along, and when you do that, it's like a blank canvas, 'This is what I'm going to do for this scene,' and you can remember previous performances and remain consistent with that. The energy created by the ensemble you have around you, it contributes to the outlook or the final view of what your character has become, and what he meant to the story."""
Ant,8,Anthony Mackie,Sam Wilson / Falcon: An Avenger who is a former pararescueman trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack. On including Falcon," Reed said that it was not done just to include the character, rather ""t served a plot point; a purpose in our story"" and allowed them to enhance Peña's ""tip montages"", which were written by production writers Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer, also adding Falcon ""seemed like the right character — not a marquee character like Iron Man or Thor, but the right level of hero."" Rudd and McKay decided to include Falcon after watching Captain America: The Winter Soldier."

On his character, Dastmalchian said that he ""had this idea that Kurt was born and raised in a town even further out than Siberia and he was just an amazing computer wizard who fell in with the wrong people. But he was obsessed with two things: Saturday Night Fever and Elvis Presley, hence the polyester shirts unbuttoned too far and the hair in that pompadour."" Dastmalchian later stated that the character's last name was Goreshter, as a tribute to the actress."
Ant,13,Michael Douglas,Hank Pym: A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent," entomologist, and physicist who became the original Ant-Man in 1963 after discovering the subatomic particles that make the transformation possible. He later mentors Lang to take over the role. Douglas compared his decision to join a superhero film to his role in Behind the Candelabra saying, ""Sometimes—like  they didn't see you for Liberace—you've got to shake them up a little bit and have some fun."" Describing Pym, Douglas said, ""He's sort of a Northern California, formal guy. He's lost control of his company. He lives in sort of a time warp. He was always a bit of a tinkerer. He's got a lab, plus a lot of other stuff, in his basement that we find out about. He's certainly bitter about what happened with his company and deeply scared of what the future might hold—because he himself, after having gotten small so many times, it's difficult. He looks and tries to find a guy that he can work with and has the right characteristics, which is ."" Douglas indicated that he would not be wearing the Ant-Man suit."

Suicide Squad,2,Will Smith,Floyd Lawton / Deadshot:An expert marksman and assassin. A mercenary by day and a concerned father by night," Deadshot is a conflicted criminal who enjoys the hunt but still tries to do right by his young daughter. Smith was simultaneously offered to appear in Suicide Squad and Independence Day: Resurgence, the sequel to Independence Day which he starred in. Smith opted to portray Deadshot, saying that the choice was ""nothing about the qualities of the movie—but the choice of trying to go forward versus clinging and clawing backwards."""
Suicide Squad,3,Jared Leto,"The Joker:A psychopathic crime boss and the nemesis of Batman. Leto described his role as ""nearly Shakespearean"" and a ""beautiful disaster of a character;"" about portraying the villain"," he stated, ""I took a pretty deep dive. But this was a unique opportunity and I couldn't imagine doing it another way. It was fun, playing these psychological games. But at the same time it was very painful."" Leto never broke character throughout filming, with Smith going as far as stating he never met him. In preparation for the role, Leto spent his time alone, listened to gospel music from the 1920s—commenting he senses ""Joker may be much older than people think""—and read literature on shamanism. Influences for the character's appearance include the work of Alejandro Jodorowsky. The Joker's tattoos were added by Ayer, who believed it gave the character a modernized gangster look. David Bowie was also cited as an influence on the character by Leto."

Robbie described Quinn as one of the Squad's most manipulative members and her relationship with Joker as ""incredibly dysfunctional,"" adding that Quinn is, ""mad about him—like, literally, mad. She's crazy. But she loves him. And it's a really unhealthy, dysfunctional relationship. But an addictive one."""

Suicide Squad,6,Jai Courtney,Digger Harkness / Captain Boomerang:A thief who uses deadly boomerangs," described as rugged, unpredictable and mouthy. About his role, Courtney stated, ""he is an absolute bogan, in the purest sense. David Ayer's first instruction was, 'find your inner dirtbag'."""
Suicide Squad,7,Jay Hernandez,Chato Santana / El Diablo:A former Los Angeles gang member who has metahuman powers that allow him to summon flames," and transform himself into a monstrous fire entity. He has squelched his fire-conjuring powers to a solitary flame as penance for the horrors he inflicted on those he loved.

Suicide Squad,8,Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje,Waylon Jones / Killer Croc:A cannibalistic metahuman criminal who suffers from a regressive atavism which caused him to develop reptilian features.

As she is not a criminal, she does not have a micro-bomb implant. Fukuhara stated that Katana ""has morals and codes. She can also slice through hundreds of people without taking a breath."""
Suicide Squad,13,Cara Delevingne,Dr. June Moone / Enchantress:An archaeologist who is possessed by an ancient evil force that transforms her into a host of a powerful sorceress," when summoned. Unleashed after a long period of imprisonment, the entity draws the attention of Waller. Delevingne described Moone as ""an adventure-seeker who's always wanted some excitement"" and Enchantress as ""a feral being."" Originally, the film was going to feature the revelation that Enchantress was being controlled by Steppenwolf, the main antagonist of Justice League , but this was scrapped after the Justice League story changed."

Gustin began researching the character during the audition process, and reading as many comics as possible.

After Flashpoint, Wally eventually gets speed powers from Doctor Alchemy and becomes Kid Flash.

The Amazing Spider,2,Andrew Garfield,Peter Parker / Spider-Man: A intellectually-gifted yet socially-introverted teenager struggling to find his place in life ever since his parents died when he was a child. When Peter sneaks inside the Oscorp building where his father worked," a genetically-enhanced spider bites him on the back of his neck, giving him inhuman abilities, similar to that of a spider's. After his uncle's murder at the hands of a thief, he takes up the mantle of a masked vigilante, ""Spider-Man,"" who targets street-level criminals using his super-human abilities and specially-constructed wrist-worn devices named ""web-shooters."" Initially using his alter-ego to hunt down his uncle's killer, he is later compelled to use his abilities to stop the growing threat of the ""Lizard"". Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little. Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, ""I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to."" After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is ""a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit."" He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. Garfield admitted to shedding a tear when first wearing his costume and that he tried to imagine ""a much better actor's face in that suit"" because seeing himself as Spider-Man ""didn't make sense to him"". He said, ""I didn’t think that the spandex would make me so emotional, but it did."" He described the suit as ""uncomfortable"" and said that he wasn't allowed to wear anything underneath it because it was so skintight, although later clarified that he wore underpants while in the suit. When filming, Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.
Max Charles plays a young Peter Parker."
The Amazing Spider,3,Emma Stone,Gwen Stacy: A high school classmate and love interest of Parker's," a smart and charismatic girl who is the chief Intern at Oscorp. For the role, Stone kept her natural blonde hair color, rather than maintaining her usual dyed red hair. She felt that she had a responsibility to educate herself on Spider-Man, admitting she ""hadn't read the comic book growing up, and my experience was with the Sam Raimi movies... I always assumed that Mary Jane was his first love"", and having only been familiar with her The Help co-star Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal in Spider-Man 3. Stone said, ""There's a part of me that really wants to please people  love Spider-Man or Gwen Stacy and want her to be done justice. I hope they'll give me license to interpret her my way."""
The Amazing Spider,4,Rhys Ifans,Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard: One of Oscorp's leading scientific minds and former partner of Peter's late father Richard Parker who attempts to engineer a revolutionary regeneration serum to help regrow limbs and human tissue. Something goes wrong," and he is transformed into a large reptilian monster. Ifans said his character spends the majority of the film as a human. While playing the 9-foot-tall reptile, Ifans was required to wear a CGI suit. Initially, a large stunt double was used as a stand-in for the role, but Ifans insisted on portraying the transformed character. Commenting on the technology used to bring his character to life, Ifans continued, ""I had a green suit on, and then this cardboard head, and these small claws... Every time you see the Lizard, the technology is so advanced now that when the Lizard's eyes move, they're my eyes. If I frown or show any emotion, they're my emotions. That's how spectacularly advanced technology is."" Ifans said that he voiced the man-beast as well, explaining, ""I'm sure the voice will be toyed with in the eventual edits, but when I was shooting the CGI moments when I wasn't human when I was Lizard, I looked like a crash-test dummy in a green leotard thing. There were many moments when I had to speak to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as the Lizard."""
The Amazing Spider,5,Denis Leary,George Stacy:Gwen's father," a police captain who hunts both Spider-Man out of distrust and the Lizard for his rampage. Leary explained that he did not know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was ""more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s , but the dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to  Tobey Maguire ones."" He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, ""said to me, 'The first time I met you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'"" Director Webb said of his casting, ""e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him."""
The Amazing Spider,6,Campbell Scott,Richard Parker: Peter's late father. He is a businessman and scientist who worked for Oscorp," his research being the Spider-venom cross species experiment said to heal or cure any sickness, one of the spiders he created ends up biting his son granting him his abilities."
The Amazing Spider,7,Irrfan Khan,Rajit Ratha: An Oscorp executive," Connors' immediate superior. Khan said he was offered what he described as this ""pivotal role"" after appearing in the TV drama series In Treatment. Webb described himself as a fan of the actor when watching the series along with the films The Namesake and The Warrior. Khan said he was uninterested in the project at first, but that his sons were excited about it and insisted he take the role."
The Amazing Spider,8,Martin Sheen,Ben Parker: Peter's uncle and Richard's brother. Sheen admitted he was unfamiliar with Spider-Man other than Maguire's portrayal," and knew little of the character Ben Parker except for knowing Cliff Robertson had played the part. Sheen described his character as a surrogate father, saying, ""I'm dealing with this adolescent who is having problems with changes, with hormones changing and his getting out of hand. I have to give him the marching orders and so forth."" Webb said, ""You think of Martin Sheen as President Bartlet . He has that sense of benevolent authority, but there's something else that's important, in terms of the dynamic that I wanted to explore, vis-à-vis Peter's relationship with his absent parents."" Webb felt that unlike the scientifically inclined Peter, Uncle Ben represented the blue-collar working man, a gap that could create a dynamic between the characters."
The Amazing Spider,9,Sally Field,"May Parker: Ben Parker's wife and Peter's aunt. Field said the main reason she felt she had to be in the film was because of producer Laura Ziskin  because she had an instinct that this was to be Ziskin's last film. After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude at being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films. Director Webb felt that ""when you cast someone like Sally"," they come with a certain level of awareness and real genuine affection, which for Aunt May is an incredibly important thing to have."" Webb said that while ""we all love Aunt May"", he wanted to create tension between May and Peter. ""He's got bruises on his face, and what happens at that moment? That can create some tension, but you want there to be love there. That's what someone like Sally Field gives you."""

He tells the story of his adult years from his late twenties to his mid thirties, and all the obstacles he overcomes before he meets ""The One"" . This story is told by the Older Ted Mosby, and narrator of the series, Bob Saget. Ted moved to New York City with his friends Marshall and Lily after graduating from Wesleyan University. In New York, he met Barney  and Robin, to whom he was immediately attracted. Ted is on a quest for happiness and ""The One"", the woman he will marry. He has many relationships, one with Robin, that reveal the qualities he wants in his future wife. At the end of each relationship, with levity, he reflects on what went wrong. Although hope to find “the one” diminishes with each failed relationship, Ted does not give up. He has more elegant and higher-class interests than his friends. He goes to great lengths to profess his love to the women in his life, but they all falter eventually. Despite these qualities, Ted often acts immaturely, such as in wild activities with Barney. In the show's finale, he says that, in Tracy, he had met the love of his life , but only after he is finished telling the story does he accept that he is ready to move on and admit he is still in love with Robin."

She and Barney get engaged and marry in the penultimate episode of the series, but divorce in the first part of the series finale, three years later. Smulders's husband Taran Killam appeared in six episodes as Gary Blauman."

He marries Robin in the penultimate episode of the series but they divorce after three years in the two-part series finale. In 2020, a failed one-night stand gives him a daughter, Ellie. Harris' husband David Burtka appeared in seven episodes as Scooter."

Enchanted,2,Amy Adams,Giselle," a singing and dancing princess-to-be who ends up almost having her dream of meeting her prince a reality. Adams was announced to have been cast in the role of Giselle on November 14, 2005. Although the studio was looking for a film star in the role, director Kevin Lima insisted on casting a lesser-known actress. Out of the 300 or so actresses who auditioned for the role, Adams stood out to Lima because not only did she look like a Disney princess but her ""commitment to the character, her ability to escape into the character's being without ever judging the character was overwhelming"". Hailing from Andalasia, Giselle displays similar traits to early Disney Princesses; Lima describes her as ""about 80% Snow White, with some traits borrowed from Cinderella and Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty... although her spunkiness comes from Ariel from The Little Mermaid"". She is ""eternally optimistic and romantic"" but is also ""very independent and true to her convictions"". Over the course of the film, she becomes more mature  but maintains her fondness of singing, kindness, innocence and optimism."
Enchanted,3,Patrick Dempsey,Robert Philip," a cynical Manhattan divorce attorney who does not believe in true love, happily-ever-after, or fairy tales since his wife left him and their daughter. He falls in love with Giselle after her adventure to New York City, and her sense of fun gradually rubs off on him over the course of the film. Lima cast Dempsey after Disney was satisfied with the casting of Adams but had wanted more well-known actors in the film. Dempsey, whose starring role on TV series Grey's Anatomy had earned him the nickname ""McDreamy"", was described by Lima as ""a modern-day Prince Charming to today's audience"". The role was challenging for Dempsey because he had to play the straight man to Adams' and Marsden's more outrageous characters."
Enchanted,4,James Marsden,Prince Edward," a dim-witted, yet brave, heroic and good-hearted, prince who ends up confused with the world of New York once he enters it. Marsden was announced to have been cast on December 6, 2005. At the time Marsden was auditioning, the role of Robert had not been cast but he decided to pursue the role of Prince Edward because he was ""more fun and he responded more to that character"". Edward is a prince in Andalasia and the stepson of Queen Narissa. He is ""very pure, very simple-minded and naive, but innocently narcissistic""."
Enchanted,5,Timothy Spall,Nathaniel," a servant of Queen Narissa, who gets controlled through his infatuation with the Queen and his own lack of self-esteem. He initially does Narissa's bidding, but ultimately realizes her true nature and rebels against her. He has a penchant for disguises."
Enchanted,6,Idina Menzel,Nancy Tremaine," a fashion designer and Robert's girlfriend. Once Giselle falls in love with Robert, she falls for Edward and leaves with him. Since the role did not require any singing, Menzel said in an interview that ""it was a compliment to be asked to just be hired on my acting talents alone"". She is named after Lady Tremaine, the stepmother from Cinderella."
Enchanted,7,Rachel Covey,Morgan Philip," Robert's 6-year-old daughter. Despite her father misunderstanding her and telling her otherwise, she believes in fairy tales and also believes that magic exists."
Enchanted,8,Susan Sarandon,Queen Narissa," Edward's evil stepmother, a sorceress, and a megalomaniac with a hatred for Giselle simply for being an obstacle for her to keep her power. Sarandon had been attracted to the project prior to Lima's involvement as director. Since Sarandon's on-screen time was relatively short, it took only two weeks to film her scenes. Narissa's mannerisms, characteristics, powers, and physical features were inspired by such classical Disney villainesses as the Evil Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty."

Avatar,2,Sam Worthington,Corporal Jake Sully," a disabled former Marine who becomes part of the Avatar Program after his twin brother is killed. His military background helps the Na'vi warriors relate to him. Cameron cast the Australian actor after a worldwide search for promising young actors, preferring relative unknowns to keep the budget down. Worthington, who was living in his car at the time, auditioned twice early in development, and he has signed on for possible sequels. Cameron felt that because Worthington had not done a major film, he would give the character ""a quality that is really real"". Cameron said he ""has that quality of being a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world"". Cameron offered the role to Matt Damon, with a 10% stake in the film's profits, but Damon turned the film down because of his commitment to the Bourne film series.
Worthington also briefly appears as Jake's deceased identical twin, Tommy."
Avatar,3,Zoe Saldana,Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite," the daughter of the leaders of the Omaticaya . She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she sees as his naiveté and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest. The character, like all the Na'vi, was created using performance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated. Saldana signed on for potential sequels."
Avatar,4,Stephen Lang,Colonel Miles Quaritch," the head of the mining operation's security detail. Fiercely consistent in his disregard for any life not recognized as human, he has a profound disregard for Pandora's inhabitants that is evident in both his actions and his language. Lang had unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in Cameron's Aliens , but the director remembered Lang and sought him for Avatar. Michael Biehn, who had worked with Cameron in Aliens, The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, was briefly considered for the role. He read the script and watched some of the 3-D footage with Cameron but was ultimately not cast."
Avatar,5,Michelle Rodriguez,Trudy Chacón, a combat pilot assigned to support the Avatar Program who is sympathetic to the Na'vi. Cameron had wanted to work with Rodriguez since seeing her in Girlfight.
Avatar,6,Giovanni Ribisi,Parker Selfridge," the corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation. While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize the attacks on the Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary and that the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence."

Oliver returns to his home city with a mission—to right the wrongs of his father and save the city from the crime that has grown in his absence.

The actor, who was already in shape from Rent-a-Goalie, did physical fitness training at Tempest Freerunning Academy in Reseda, California. Amell received archery training as well, which included watching a video on how archery has been displayed inaccurately or poorly in television and film before learning the basics of shooting a bow. For Amell, the appeal of portraying Queen was that he saw multiple roles tied to the same character: ""There's Queen the casual playboy; Queen the wounded hero; Queen the brooding Hamlet; Queen the lover; Queen the man of action, and so on"".

Titanic,2,Kate Winslet,"Rose DeWitt Bukater: Cameron said Winslet ""had the thing that you look for"" and that there was ""a quality in her face"," in her eyes,"" that he ""just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her"". Rose is a 17-year-old girl, originally from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards the RMS Titanic with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, ""She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she  that's not going to happen."" Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Gabrielle Anwar, and Reese Witherspoon had been considered for the role. When they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as ""an Audrey Hepburn type"" and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, ""He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him."" Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, ""From Your Rose"", and lobbied him by phone. ""You don't understand!"" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. ""I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!"" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role."
Titanic,3,Leonardo DiCaprio,Jack Dawson: Cameron said he needed the cast to feel they were really on the Titanic," to relive its liveliness, and ""to take that energy and give it to Jack, ... an artist who is able to have his heart soar"". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has travelled the world, including Paris. He wins two third-class tickets for the Titanic in a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight. Her fiancé's invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. Cameron's original choice for the role was River Phoenix, however he died in 1993. Though established actors like Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff were considered, Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested, but his asking price was too high. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. Jeremy Sisto did a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene . Cameron said, ""He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest."" Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, ""Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want."" Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played by James Stewart or Gregory Peck. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled ""J. Dawson"". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, a trimmer in the engine room. ""It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone,"" said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview."
Titanic,4,Billy Zane,Caledon Hockley: Caledon is Rose's arrogant and snobbish 30-year-old fiancé," who is the heir to a Pittsburgh steel fortune. He becomes increasingly embarrassed by, jealous of, and cruel about Rose's affection for Jack. The part was originally offered to Matthew McConaughey, and Rob Lowe has also gone on the record as having pursued it."
Titanic,5,Frances Fisher,Ruth DeWitt Bukater: Rose's widowed mother," who arranges her daughter's engagement to Cal to maintain her family's high-society status. Like many aristocratic passengers portrayed in the film, her disposition is elitist and frivolous. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage. She strongly dislikes Jack, even though he saved her daughter's life."
Titanic,6,Gloria Stuart,Rose Dawson Calvert: Rose narrates the film in a modern-day framing device. Cameron stated," ""In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is  101 years, and she connects us in a way through history."" The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the ""Heart of the Ocean"" after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She shares the story of her time aboard the ship, and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role. Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, ""My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties."" Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. ""But  was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and  spirit,"" stated Cameron. ""I saw this joie de vivre in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person."""
Titanic,7,Bill Paxton,"Brock Lovett: A treasure hunter looking for the ""Heart of the Ocean"" in the wreck of the Titanic in the present. Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He later reflects at the film's conclusion that"," despite thinking about Titanic for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose's story."
Titanic,8,Suzy Amis,Lizzy Calvert: Rose's granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns of her grandmother's romantic past with Jack Dawson.
Titanic,9,Danny Nucci,Fabrizio: Jack's Italian best friend," who boards the RMS Titanic with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio fails to board a lifeboat when the Titanic sinks and is killed when one of the ship's funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him and several other passengers to death."
Titanic,10,David Warner,Spicer Lovejoy: An ex-Pinkerton constable," Lovejoy is Cal's English valet and bodyguard, who keeps an eye on Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack rescuing her. He dies when the Titanic splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner had appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries S.O.S. Titanic."
Titanic,11,Jason Barry,Tommy Ryan: An Irish third-class passenger who befriends Jack and Fabrizio. Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.,
Titanic,12,Kathy Bates,"Margaret ""Molly"" Brown: Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women"," including Ruth, as ""vulgar"" and ""new money"". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes  when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered Lifeboat 6 from Quartermaster Robert Hichens. Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film. Reba McEntire was offered the role, but had to turn it down, because it conflicted with her touring schedule."
Titanic,13,Victor Garber,Thomas Andrews: The ship's builder," Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a ""mathematical certainty"" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the Titanic, this story, which was published in a 1912 book  and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40 a.m. There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment. It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation."
Titanic,14,Bernard Hill,Captain Edward John Smith: Smith planned to make the Titanic his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the wheelhouse on the bridge as the ship sinks," dying when the windows implode from the water whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat ""B""."
Titanic,15,Jonathan Hyde,J. Bruce Ismay: White Star Line's ignorant," boorish managing director, who influences Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this action appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence. After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his ""unsinkable"" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C  just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned."
Titanic,16,Eric Braeden,John Jacob Astor IV: A first-class passenger whom Rose  calls the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife Madeleine  as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction," Astor asks if Jack is connected to the ""Boston Dawsons"", a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in."
Titanic,17,Bernard Fox,"Colonel Archibald Gracie IV: The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that ""women and machinery don't mix"""," and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox had portrayed Frederick Fleet in the 1958 film A Night to Remember."
Titanic,18,Michael Ensign,Benjamin Guggenheim: A mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert  to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose," Guggenheim refers to him as a ""bohemian"". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman."
Titanic,19,Jonathan Evans-Jones,Wallace Hartley: The ship's bandmaster and violinist who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins," he leads the band in a final performance of ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"", to the tune of Bethany, and dies in the sinking."
Titanic,20,Mark Lindsay Chapman,Chief Officer Henry Wilde: The ship's chief officer," who lets Cal on board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue."
Titanic,21,Ewan Stewart,First Officer William Murdoch: The officer who is put in charge of the bridge on the night the ship struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats," Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation. A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a £5000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize. Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the ""women and children first"" policy. According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an ""honorable man,"" not of a man ""gone bad"" or of a ""cowardly murderer."" He added, ""I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism."""
Titanic,22,Jonathan Phillips,Second Officer Charles Lightoller. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water," and following the collision, suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster."
Titanic,23,Simon Crane,Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall: The officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.,
Titanic,24,Ioan Gruffudd,Fifth Officer Harold Lowe: The ship's only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.,
Titanic,25,Edward Fletcher,Sixth Officer James Moody: The ship's only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.
Titanic,26,James Lancaster,Father Thomas Byles: Second-class passenger Father Byles," a Catholic priest from England, is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments."
Titanic,27,Lew Palter and Elsa Raven,Isidor and Ida Straus: Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company," a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, his wife Ida is offered a place in a lifeboat, but refuses, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed embracing each other as water fills their stateroom."
Titanic,28,Martin Jarvis,Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon: A Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck," these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the ""women and children first"" policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time  stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the Titanic was almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place  after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them."
Titanic,29,Rosalind Ayres,Lady Duff-Gordon: A world-famous fashion designer and Sir Cosmo's wife. She is rescued in Lifeboat 1 with her husband. They never lived down rumors that they had forbidden the lifeboat's crew to return to the wreck site in case they would be swamped.,
Titanic,30,Rochelle Rose,Noël Leslie," Countess of Rothes: The Countess is shown to be friendly with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the steerage passengers."
Titanic,31,Scott G. Anderson,Frederick Fleet: The lookout who saw the iceberg. Fleet escapes the sinking ship aboard Lifeboat 6.,
Titanic,32,Paul Brightwell,Quartermaster Robert Hichens: One of the ship's six quartermasters and at the ship's wheel at the time of collision. He is in charge of lifeboat 6. He refuses to go back and pick up survivors after the sinking and eventually the boat is commandeered by Molly Brown.,

According to the real Joughin's testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol. In a deleted scene, he's shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle."
Titanic,37,Terry Forrestal,Chief Engineer Joseph G. Bell: Bell and his men worked until the last minute to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out. Bell and all of the engineers died in the bowels of the Titanic.,

Parks and Recreation,2,Amy Poehler,Leslie Knope," a mid-level bureaucrat with a strong love of her hometown of Pawnee, who has not let politics dampen her sense of optimism ; her ultimate goal is to become President of the United States. Poehler departed from the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live, where she was a cast member for nearly seven years, to star in Parks and Recreation. It was only after she was cast that Daniels and Schur established the series' general concept and the script for the pilot was written."
Parks and Recreation,3,Rashida Jones,Ann Perkins," a nurse and political outsider who gradually becomes more involved in Pawnee government through her friendship with Leslie. Jones was among the first to be cast by Daniels and Schur in 2008, when the series was still being considered as a spin-off to The Office, where Jones had played Jim Halpert's girlfriend Karen Filippelli, who formerly worked at the Stamford Branch but was soon transferred to the Scranton Branch in the third season. She and Lowe departed in the middle of season 6, and she returned for a guest appearance later in the season. Jones and Lowe returned in the series finale, along with the COVID-19 pandemic special."
Parks and Recreation,4,Paul Schneider,Mark Brendanawicz," a city planner who entered the field with a sense of optimism, but has since become jaded and disillusioned. Schneider said early in the series he was insecure in the role because he was still trying to figure out the character's motivations. Schneider left the cast after the second season and the character is not referenced at any point during the remainder of the series' run."
Parks and Recreation,5,Aziz Ansari,Tom Haverford," Leslie's sarcastic and underachieving subordinate, who eventually begins to consider leaving his city hall job to pursue his own entrepreneurial interests. As with Jones, Daniels and Schur had intended to cast Ansari from the earliest stages of the development of Parks and Recreation."
Parks and Recreation,6,Nick Offerman,Ron Swanson," the parks and recreation director who, as a staunch libertarian, believes in as small a government as possible. As such, Ron strives to make his department as ineffective as he can, and favors hiring employees who do not care about their jobs or are poor at them. Nevertheless, Ron consistently demonstrates that he secretly cares deeply about his fellow co-workers."
Parks and Recreation,7,Aubrey Plaza,April Ludgate," a cynical and uninterested parks department intern who speaks in a monotonic voice. She eventually becomes the perfect assistant for Ron. The role was written specifically for Plaza; after meeting her, casting director Allison Jones told Schur, ""I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show."""
Parks and Recreation,8,Chris Pratt,Andy Dwyer," a goofy and dim-witted but lovable slacker and Ann's ex-boyfriend. Pratt was originally intended to be a guest star and the character Andy was initially meant to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make him a regular cast member starting with season two."
Parks and Recreation,9,Adam Scott,Ben Wyatt," a brilliant but socially awkward government official trying to redeem his past as a failed mayor in his youth. Scott left his starring role on the Starz comedy series Party Down to join the series, starting with the penultimate second-season episode, ""The Master Plan."""
Parks and Recreation,10,Rob Lowe,Chris Traeger," an excessively positive and extremely health-conscious government official. Lowe was introduced with Scott and was originally expected to depart after a string of guest appearances, but later signed a multi-year contract to become a regular cast member. He and Rashida Jones departed from the series in the season 6 episode, ""Ann and Chris"", returning in the series finale and the 2020 special."
Parks and Recreation,11,Jim O'Heir and Retta made regular appearances respectively,"Garry ""Jerry"" Gergich and Donna Meagle since the first season"," but their personalities did not become developed until the second season. Schur said the Parks and Recreation staff liked the actors so he decided to include them in the show and ""figured we'd work it out later"". A throwaway joke at Jerry's expense in the episode ""Practice Date"" led him to be established as the inept co-worker the rest of the department callously picks on. Donna was developed as a sassy hedonist whose mysterious life is occasionally hinted at. It was not until the third season they became considered regular cast members, and were added to the credits during the sixth season."
Parks and Recreation,12,Billy Eichner,Craig Middlebrooks," an overly passionate employee of the Pawnee local government, began working for Pawnee when Eagleton merged with Pawnee. He was recurring during season 6 and began being billed as a member of the regular cast in the fourth episode of season 7."

Daredevil,2,Charlie Cox,"Matt Murdock / Daredevil: A blind lawyer who leads a double life as the vigilante Daredevil. Season one showrunner Steven DeKnight explained that Murdock is ""not super strong. He's not invulnerable... he just has senses that are better than a normal human's."" On the character's ""grey"" morals"," he noted, ""He's a lawyer by day, and he's taken this oath. But every night he breaks that oath, and goes out and does very violent things."" The character's Catholicism plays a large role in the series, with DeKnight calling him ""one of the most, if not the most, religious characters in the Marvel Universe"". Cox worked with blind consultant Joe Strechay, and was conscious of what his eyes were doing at all times, to ensure they would not look at or react to something unlike a blind person. Skylar Gaertner plays a young Matt Murdock."
Daredevil,3,Deborah Ann Woll,Karen Page: An enigmatic young woman whose quest for justice sends her crashing into Murdock's life. After portraying Jessica Hamby in True Blood from 2008 to 2014," Woll specifically tried to ""steer differently than that"" with Page. Woll noted that Page's backstory would be different from the one from the comics, saying, ""In the comic books, in the beginning Karen is very innocent, and then towards the end she's really swung a full 180, she's in a lot of trouble, so I wanted to find a way to make her both of those things at the same time. Can she be a really wonderful, kind person who is a little bit attracted to danger? She's not just always getting into trouble because 'Oh, silly woman!' Karen is actually looking for it, and she won't let her fear stop her from finding the truth."""
Daredevil,4,Elden Henson,"Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson: Murdock's best friend and law partner. In April 2015"," Henson spoke of his excitement for the character's role in the series, saying ""I was really excited as I was getting the scripts and reading that Foggy wasn't just a useless sidekick. He's not just comic relief. I mean, he is some of those things. He does have comic relief, but it was exciting to know that these other characters would have their own path and their own things that they're dealing with."""
Daredevil,5,Toby Leonard Moore,"James Wesley: Wilson Fisk's right-hand man. Moore described Wesley as both charming and ""dastardly as all hell"".",
Daredevil,6,Vondie Curtis-Hall,Ben Urich: An investigative journalist for the New York Bulletin.,
Daredevil,7,Bob Gunton,Leland Owlsley: A Wall Street financialist," accountant, and a key figure in Wilson Fisk's plans for Hell's Kitchen."
Daredevil,8,Ayelet Zurer,Vanessa Marianna-Fisk: An art gallery employee who," unlike the comic version, knows of and accepts Wilson Fisk's true dealings and eventually marries him."
Daredevil,9,Rosario Dawson,"Claire Temple: A nurse who helps Murdock. The character is an amalgam of the comic characters Claire Temple and Night Nurse. The character was originally going to be ""the actual Night Nurse"""," but was merged with Temple when the writers learned that Marvel Studios had plans for that character in their films. Dawson explained that Temple ""is a normal person and she becomes more heroic in a way that she maybe didn't expect"", and ""She's not a love interest—she's this skeptical eye looking at this strange situation. She's the one who can be like, 'You're not really good at this.' That makes it feel more real."""
Daredevil,10,Vincent D'Onofrio,Wilson Fisk / Kingpin: A powerful businessman and crime lord whose interests in the future of Hell's Kitchen brings him into conflict with Murdock and Daredevil. D'Onofrio stated that he hoped his portrayal of Fisk was a new way to look at the character," and that it would be the definitive portrayal of Fisk. DeKnight detailed that ""Fisk has very many different aspects so it's not all, ""I want to conquer the city and make a lot of money"". In our story, we tell the story of how he met his wife Vanessa and how they fell in love"". He also said that ""if you're looking for a juicy, multi-faceted crime drama, Wilson Fisk was the obvious choice to play the antagonist ...  really felt like the right yin to the yang for Matt, and for what we wanted to do this season."" Cole Jensen plays a young Wilson Fisk."
Daredevil,11,Jon Bernthal,Frank Castle / Punisher: A vigilante who aims to clean up Hell's Kitchen by any means necessary," no matter how lethal the results. DeKnight said this version of Punisher would be ""completely the Marvel version,"" as previous portrayals did not appear under the Marvel Studios / Marvel Television banner. He also felt Bernthal's Punisher would not be as ""graphically violent"" as in Punisher: War Zone. Season two showrunner Doug Petrie stated that Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver was an influence on the character, as well as current events, saying, ""Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings."" Bernthal added that ""This character has resonated with law enforcement and military ... and the best thing about him is that if he offends you, he just doesn't care."""
Daredevil,12,Élodie Yung,Elektra Natchios: A mysterious and dangerous woman from Murdock's past. The character was referred to in the first season," before Yung was cast in the role. Describing Elektra's effect on Murdock, Petrie called her ""the best bad girlfriend you can possibly have. She does everything wrong and attractive, she's  id, the wild side. Matt is always taming his wild side. Elektra just lets it out. He's both repulsed and deeply drawn to that."" Yung described Elektra as ""kind of a sociopath. This world is a game for her. It's like a chess game, and what motivates her is what she wants. She'll use anything she needs to use to get to her goal, and if she needs to kill people, she would."" She added that Elektra is neither good nor bad, but a ""person with different traits"" and layers. Lily Chee plays a young Elektra."
Daredevil,13,Stephen Rider,Blake Tower: A New York district attorney who assists Daredevil with information to help track down and capture criminals,
Daredevil,14,Joanne Whalley,Maggie Grace: A nun with strong opinions who speaks her mind, and cares for Murdock as he recovers from his injuries. She is later revealed to be Murdock's mother.
Daredevil,15,Jay Ali,"Rahul ""Ray"" Nadeem: An honest and ambitious FBI agent who takes on Fisk's case.",
Daredevil,16,Wilson Bethel,"Benjamin ""Dex"" Poindexter: A psychopathic FBI agent who is able to use almost any object as a lethal projectile. Bethel described his character as ""a really nuanced portrait of a man with some very serious psychological issues"""," and said that to prepare for the role, he had to read up on experiences of psychoses and schizophrenia. Furthermore, he said Dex needed the ""structure of the bureau to keep the darkness inside him subdued"". Executive producer Jeph Loeb said the character's interaction with Wilson Fisk would corrupt Poindexter and turn him into a Daredevil adversary."

In the third season, Luke is fired from the NYPD after refusing to cooperate in the case of Ollie's sudden disappearance and matricide, not wanting to endanger anyone else with the existence of the Shadow World and steps down as alpha since he still cares about Clary, especially after most of his followers justifiably questioned his leadership.

Ritter described the character as ""very rough around the edges, and dry and sarcastic and a total asshole sometimes. But I think at her core she's a good person."" She put on 10 pounds  of muscle for the role. Elizabeth Cappuccino portrayed a young Jessica."
Jessica Jones,3,Mike Colter,Luke Cage: A man with superhuman strength and unbreakable skin," whom Jones encounters in the course of an investigation.

Colter was pleased and surprised that the audience ""got"" the character, as Luke ""was a man of few words and a lot of subtext,"" which was refreshing: ""we were going for this character in a way that said little but spoke volumes ... I felt people got the subtleties."""

Jones' best friend was going to be Carol Danvers when Rosenberg was developing the series at ABC but was changed to Walker due to the changing nature of the MCU and the fact that Danvers would be featured in her own film. Rosenberg ultimately found this to be ""much more appropriate ... it was better that  best friend was not someone with powers. It actually ends up being a really great mirror for her."" Loeb said, ""what's most important is the relationship between  and Jessica, and how these two women who are  could be that different, and yet believe in the same kinds of things.""

There's going to be moments where some of the things that she does is pretty questionable.

After being possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance in the fourth season finale, the Kree blood that resurrected Coulson is burned away and he ultimately dies following the fifth-season finale. Gregg plays a new character, Sarge, in season six, and portrays a Chronicom-enhanced Life Model Decoy version of Coulson in season seven."
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,3,Ming-Na Wen,Melinda May:Joss Whedon had the character," a S.H.I.E.L.D. ace pilot and weapons expert, nicknamed ""the Cavalry"", and originally listed with the name Agent Althea Rice on casting sheets, ""rolling around in his head"" for a long time. Wen was given some backstory for the character to prepare, but was not told how she gained her reputation; with May's past revealed in ""Melinda"", Wen called it ""devastating ... To have learned what she had to do, for the good of the many ... I can understand why it would traumatize her so much and cause her to retreat."" Wen called May ""unconventionally maternal"", and said that it is her relationship with Coulson that makes her stay at S.H.I.E.L.D., despite her past."
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,4,Brett Dalton,"Grant Ward and Hive:Ward is a Hydra agent who poses as a S.H.I.E.L.D. black ops specialist. From the conception of the series it was decided that he would be a traitor. Jed Whedon explained that they wanted to have ""infiltration based on betrayal"" on a small scale to represent the same thing happening on a massive scale"," and to make the Hydra revelation more personal for the characters. Dalton felt that Ward was always more loyal to his Hydra superior John Garrett than to Hydra itself, and that he would become more of a wildcard after Garrett's death, though still an antagonist to S.H.I.E.L.D. Ward is killed by Coulson in season three, and his body is possessed by an ancient Inhuman, Hive. Hive is killed in the season three finale. Dalton returned to the series in its fourth season to portray Ward in the virtual reality Framework, where he is Johnson's boyfriend. Austin Lyon portrays a young Ward."
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,5,Chloe Bennet,Skye / Daisy Johnson / Quake:An Inhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agent with the ability to manipulate vibrations and create earthquakes. The character of Skye was always intended to become the MCU version of Johnson," having consequences for the character's relationships with the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, especially Coulson. Bennet felt that the character was someone who would wear her heart on her sleeve while having some control over her emotions. Wen noted that the character evolves from being ""anti-establishment into suddenly being someone who wants to create an establishment that would help"" the Inhumans. In the third season she no longer goes by ""Skye"" and gains the public name ""Quake""."
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,6,Iain De Caestecker,Leo Fitz:An agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who specializes in engineering," especially weapons technology. De Caestecker described the character as ""quite passionate about what he does"" but not emotionally intelligent. Fitz has a close relationship with Simmons; De Caestecker says they ""just kind of fit each other in a very weird way."" The character sustains brain injuries at the end of the first season. The writers researched brain trauma with doctors and experts before approaching it in the series. De Caestecker did his own research as well, feeling it is ""something that should never be trivialized. It's a real and serious thing ... we just have to constantly be respectful towards it."""
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,7,Elizabeth Henstridge,"Jemma Simmons:A S.H.I.E.L.D. biochemist who specializes in life sciences . Henstridge described her character as ""intelligent and focused and curious...she's got a wonderful relationship with Fitz. They kind of bounce off each other."" As Fitz and Simmons begin to spend time apart during the series"," Henstridge noted that it ""brings a whole new dynamic just to them as characters"" since they have been nearly inseparable since first meeting. On the harsher side of Simmons seen in later seasons, Henstridge noted that the character has ""always been very mathematical in a way"". Simmons is ""profoundly"" changed after being trapped on the planet Maveth for six months."
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,8,Nick Blood,"Lance Hunter:A mercenary before agreeing to join S.H.I.E.L.D. Blood described Hunter as someone who ""doesn't bow down to the etiquette of the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy."" He later elaborated that the character feels very independent"," so would probably not want to admit no longer feeling like an outsider. Also, ""he doesn't have too much respect for authority and titles...If Coulson does something he respects, that's all good. If he doesn't, he's going to say something."" On Hunter's on-again, off-again relationship with Bobbi Morse, Blood said, ""there is a lot of truth in it of those relationships you have where it's kind of, 'can't live with each other, can't kill each other'""."
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,9,Adrianne Palicki,Bobbi Morse:Hunter's ex-wife and an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who spent time undercover within Hydra. Palicki was approached by the showrunners specifically for the part during season two. Palicki already had martial arts and gun training," but had to learn to use the character's signature arnis sticks; she noted similarities between Morse's fighting style and that of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow from the MCU films. Showrunner Jeffrey Bell said the character is more loyal to an idea than anything else, so what may seem in the short term as a betrayal by her is usually for what she sees as the greater good."
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,10,Henry Simmons,"Alphonso ""Mack"" Mackenzie:A S.H.I.E.L.D. mechanic with a distrust of the alien and superhuman. Simmons said the character is more worried about contributing in his own way and getting his job done away from the field. Mack does not like violence"," but does ""what he has to do."" Mack reveals in the third season that he relies on his ""faith"", implying that he is a Christian. Dee Hogan of The Mary Sue described this as ""a refreshingly positive portrayal of people of faith, as Mack demonstrates the quiet confidence and love rather than the aggression and bigotry that's so often associated with it."" Mack becomes the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D. in season six."
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,11,Luke Mitchell,"Lincoln Campbell:An Inhuman with the ability to manipulate electrical charges. The character was introduced because the series already featured ""a guy with no eyes"" and ""a woman who now is covered in thorns"" but"," like the X-Men, there are also Inhumans who are ""just attractive people with powers"", and so Campbell represents them in the series. Campbell dies in the third-season finale, making him the ""Fallen Agent"" that the series had been teasing for the entire second half of that season. The decision was made because the producers did not want ""a body count show, but it is a real world with real stakes."""
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,12,John Hannah,Holden Radcliffe:A transhumanist who believes in the improvement of humanity through enhancement. Radcliffe initially worked with Hive before joining S.H.I.E.L.D.," where he begins work on transferring his artificial intelligence AIDA to a Life Model Decoy, an old S.H.I.E.L.D. project."
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,13,Natalia Cordova-Buckley,"Elena ""Yo-Yo"" Rodriguez:A Colombian Inhuman who can move at super speed for a beat of her heart"," before returning to the point she started from. She reluctantly joins S.H.I.E.L.D. and becomes a part of the Secret Warriors, eventually growing close to Mack, who gives her the nickname ""Yo-Yo"". When first portraying the character, Cordova-Buckley smiled whenever Rodriguez was about to use her abilities, to show an adrenaline rush and the feeling of having such power. After positive fan responses to this, the actress morphed this trait into a more mischievous personality for the character."
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,14,Jeff Ward,"Deke Shaw: A ""roguish scavenger"" on the Lighthouse space station in the year 2091", who returns to the present with the S.H.I.E.L.D. team and learns he is the grandson of Fitz and Simmons.

The Matrix,2,Keanu Reeves,Thomas Anderson/Neo: A computer programmer," born Thomas A. Anderson, who secretly operates as a hacker named Neo. Reeves described his character as someone who felt that something was wrong, and was searching for Morpheus and the truth to break free. Will Smith turned down the role of Neo to make Wild Wild West, because of skepticism over the film's ambitious bullet time special effects. He later stated he was ""not mature enough as an actor"" at that time, and that if given the role, he ""would have messed it up"". Smith praised Reeves for his portrayal. Nicolas Cage also turned down the part because of ""family obligations"". Warner Bros. sought Brad Pitt or Val Kilmer for the role. When both declined, Leonardo DiCaprio initially accepted the role, but ultimately turned it down because he did not want to do a visual effects film directly after Titanic. The studio pushed for Reeves, who won the role over Johnny Depp, the Wachowskis' first choice. Lorenzo di Bonaventura stated that the screenplay was also sent to Sandra Bullock, with the suggestion of rewriting Neo as a female."
The Matrix,3,Laurence Fishburne,Morpheus: A human freed from the Matrix and captain of the Nebuchadnezzar. Fishburne stated that once he read the script," he did not understand why other people found it confusing. However, he doubted if the movie would ever be made, because it was ""so smart"". The Wachowskis instructed Fishburne to base his performance on the character Morpheus in Neil Gaiman's Sandman comics. Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson and Val Kilmer were also considered for the part."
The Matrix,4,Carrie-Anne Moss,Trinity: A human freed by Morpheus," a crewmember of the Nebuchadnezzar, and later Neo's romantic interest. After reading the script, Moss stated that at first, she did not believe she had to do the extreme acrobatic actions as described in the script. She also doubted how the Wachowskis would get to direct a movie with a budget so large, but after spending an hour with them going through the storyboard, she understood why some people would trust them. Moss mentioned that she underwent a three-hour physical test during casting, so she knew what to expect subsequently. The role made Moss, who later said, ""I had no career before. None."" Janet Jackson was initially approached for the role but scheduling conflicts prevented her from accepting it. In an interview, she stated that turning down the role was difficult for her, so she later referenced The Matrix in the 'Intro' and 'Outro' interludes on her tenth studio album Discipline. Sandra Bullock, who was previously approached for the role of Neo, was also offered the role of Trinity, but she turned it down. Salma Hayek and Jada Pinkett Smith  both auditioned for the role."
The Matrix,5,Hugo Weaving,"Agent Smith: A sentient ""Agent"" program of the Matrix whose purpose is to destroy Zion and stop humans from getting out of the Matrix. Unlike other Agents"," he has ambitions to free himself from his duties. Weaving stated that he found the character amusing and enjoyable to play. He developed a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither robotic nor human, and also said that the Wachowskis' voices had influenced his voice in the film. When filming began, Weaving mentioned that he was excited to be a part of something that would extend him. Jean Reno was offered the role, but declined, unwilling to move to Australia for the production."
The Matrix,6,Joe Pantoliano,Cypher: Another human freed by Morpheus," and a crewmember of the Nebuchadnezzar, but one who regrets taking the red pill and seeks to be returned to the Matrix, later betraying the rebels to Agent Smith. Pantoliano had worked with the Wachowskis prior to appearing in The Matrix, starring in their 1996 film Bound."
The Matrix,7,Marcus Chong,"Tank: The ""operator"" of the Nebuchadnezzar and Dozer's brother; they are both ""natural""  humans", born outside of the Matrix.

Inception,1,Directed by: Christopher Nolan,Written by: Christopher Nolan,"Produced by: Emma Thomas"","" Christopher Nolan","Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio"","" Ken Watanabe"","" Joseph Gordon-Levitt"","" Marion Cotillard"","" Elliot Page[a]"","" Tom Hardy"","" Cillian Murphy"","" Tom Berenger"","" Michael Caine",Cinematography: Wally Pfister,Edited by: Lee Smith,Music by: Hans Zimmer,Productioncompanies: Productioncompanies,Distributed by: Warner Bros. Pictures,Release dates: Release dates,Running time: Running time,"Countries: United States[2]"","" United Kingdom[2]",Language: English,Budget: $160 million[3],Box office: $836.8 million[3]
Inception,2,Leonardo DiCaprio,Dom Cobb," a professional thief who specializes in conning secrets from his victims by infiltrating their dreams. DiCaprio was the first actor to be cast in the film. Both Brad Pitt and Will Smith were offered the role, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Cobb's role is compared to ""the haunted widower in a Gothic romance""."
Inception,3,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Arthur," Cobb's partner who manages and researches the missions. Gordon-Levitt compared Arthur to the producer of Cobb's art, ""the one saying, 'Okay, you have your vision; now I'm going to figure out how to make all the nuts and bolts work so you can do your thing'"".: 7  The actor did all but one of his stunt scenes and said the preparation ""was a challenge and it would have to be for it to look real"". James Franco was in talks with Christopher Nolan to play Arthur, but was ultimately unavailable due to scheduling conflicts."
Inception,4,Elliot Page,Ariadne," a graduate student of architecture who is recruited to construct the various dreamscapes, which are described as mazes. The name Ariadne alludes to a princess of Greek myth, daughter of King Minos, who aided the hero Theseus by giving him a sword and a ball of string to help him navigate the labyrinth which was the prison of the Minotaur. Nolan said that Page was chosen for being a ""perfect combination of freshness and savvy and maturity beyond  years"".: 8  Page said their character acts as a proxy to the audience, as ""she's just learning about these ideas and, in essence, assists the audience in learning about dream sharing""."
Inception,5,Tom Hardy,Eames," a sharp-tongued associate of Cobb. He is referred to as a fence but his specialty is forgery, more accurately identity theft. Eames uses his ability to impersonate others inside the dream world in order to manipulate Fischer. Hardy described his character as ""an old, Graham Greene-type diplomat; sort of faded, shabby, grandeur—the old Shakespeare lovey mixed with somebody from Her Majesty's Special Forces"", who wears ""campy, old money"" costumes."
Inception,6,Ken Watanabe,Mr. Saito," a Japanese businessman who employs Cobb for the team's mission. Nolan wrote the role with Watanabe in mind, as he wanted to work with him again after Batman Begins.: 10  Inception is Watanabe's first work in a contemporary setting where his primary language is English. Watanabe tried to emphasize a different characteristic of Saito in every dream level: ""First chapter in my castle, I pick up some hidden feelings of the cycle. It's magical, powerful and then the first dream. And back to the second chapter, in the old hotel, I pick up  sharp and more calm and smart and it's a little bit  different process to make up the character of any movie""."
Inception,7,Dileep Rao,"Yusuf. Rao describes Yusuf as ""an avant-garde pharmacologist"," who is a resource for people, like Cobb, who want to do this work unsupervised, unregistered and unapproved of by anyone"". Co-producer Jordan Goldberg said the role of the chemist was ""particularly tough because you don't want him to seem like some kind of drug dealer"", and that Rao was cast for being ""funny, interesting and obviously smart"".: 11"
Inception,8,Cillian Murphy,Robert Michael Fischer," the heir to a business empire and the team's target.: 10  Murphy said Fischer was portrayed as ""a petulant child who's in need of a lot of attention from his father, he has everything he could ever want materially, but he's deeply lacking emotionally"". The actor also researched the sons of Rupert Murdoch, ""to add to that the idea of living in the shadow of someone so immensely powerful""."
Inception,9,Tom Berenger,Peter Browning," Robert Fischer's godfather and fellow executive at the Fischers' company. Berenger said Browning acts as a ""surrogate father"" to Fischer, who calls the character ""Uncle Peter"", and emphasized that ""Browning has been with  his whole life and has probably spent more quality time with him than his own father"".: 11"
Inception,10,Marion Cotillard,Mal Cobb," Dom's deceased wife. She is a manifestation of Dom's guilt about the real cause of Mal's suicide. He is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor. Nolan described Mal as ""the essence of the femme fatale,"" and DiCaprio praised Cotillard's performance, saying that ""she can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the same moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character"".: 9–10"
Inception,11,Pete Postlethwaite,Maurice Fischer, Robert Fischer's father and the dying founder of a business empire.
Inception,12,Michael Caine,Professor Stephen Miles," Cobb's mentor and father-in-law,: 11  and Ariadne's college professor who recommends her to the team."
Inception,13,Lukas Haas,Nash, an architect in Cobb's employment who betrays the team and is later replaced by Ariadne.
Inception,14,Talulah Riley,a woman," credited as ""Blonde"", whom Eames disguises himself as in a dream. Riley liked the role, despite it being minimal: ""I get to wear a nice dress, pick up men in bars, and shove them in elevators. It was good to do something adultish. Usually I play 15-year-old English schoolgirls."""

Princess Mononoke,2,"Yōji Matsuda voices Prince Ashitaka , the last Ainu prince of the Emishi tribe whose traveling companion is Yakul , a red elk , a fictional species of elk that Miyazaki created for the film. Novelist Ali Shaw has described Yakul","being more similar to a red Lechwe than an elk. Miyazaki called Ashitaka a ""melancholic boy who has a fate"" and stated that Ashitaka's curse ""is similar to the lives of people "". Ashitaka's English voice actor Billy Crudup stated that he liked Ashitaka as ""an unexpected hero. He's not your usual wild"," brave guy. He's really just a young, earnest man who's trying to lead a valuable life and protect his village."""

Princess Mononoke,4,"Yūko Tanaka provides the voice of Lady Eboshi , the ruler of Irontown who continually clears the forest. Miyazaki stated that Eboshi was supposed to have a traumatic past, although it is not specifically mentioned in the film. Miyazaki said that Eboshi has a strong and secure personality, evident in the fact that she let Ashitaka move freely through the settlement unescorted, despite his unclear motives. He also said that Eboshi does not acknowledge the Emperor's authority in Irontown, a revolutionary view for the time, and displays an atypical attitude for a woman of that era in that she wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice herself or those around her for her dreams. Miyazaki also said that Eboshi resembles a shirabyōshi. Eboshi's English voice actress Minnie Driver stated that she was interested in ""the challenge of playing  woman who supports industry and represents the interests of man, in terms of achievement and greed."" Driver viewed Eboshi","""a warrior"," an innovator and a protector."""

Breaking Bad,2,Bryan Cranston,Walter White," a high-school chemistry teacher who, shortly after his 50th birthday, is diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer and turns to making meth to secure his family's finances. As his shady business progresses, Walter gains a notorious reputation under the alias of ""Heisenberg"". Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he ... should really focus on doing something else. But I think any good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it, because you can ease the tension to an audience when it's necessary, and then build it back up again. Walt White has no clue he's occasionally funny, but as an actor, I recognize when there are comedic moments and opportunities."
Breaking Bad,3,Anna Gunn,Skyler White," Walter's wife who was pregnant with their second child before his diagnosis and who becomes increasingly suspicious of her husband after he begins behaving in unfamiliar ways. Gunn sees Skyler as ""grounded, tough, smart and driven"". Gunn sees Skyler's stalled writing career as her biggest dream, saying, ""I think she really deep down yearns to be an artist and to be creative and productive."""
Breaking Bad,4,Aaron Paul,Jesse Pinkman," Walter's cooking partner and former student. Paul sees Jesse as a funny kid. ""He's just this lost soul – I don't think he's a bad kid, he just got mixed in the wrong crowd."" Paul elaborated on the character's background, saying, ""He doesn't come from an abusive, alcoholic background. But maybe he just didn't relate to his father, maybe his father was too strict and too proper for Jesse."" Paul compared the character's relationship with Walt to The Odd Couple."
Breaking Bad,5,Dean Norris,Hank Schrader," Marie's husband, Walter and Skyler's brother-in-law and a DEA agent. At the beginning of the series, Hank was intended to be the ""comic relief"". Norris, who has played several policemen before in film and television, stated: Having played so many cops, I've talked with a lot of technical advisers, so I've been able to pick up a lot. Coincidentally, one of my best friends growing up is a cop in Chicago, and one of my other best friends out in LA is a sheriff. So I get to see all the components of that culture."
Breaking Bad,6,Betsy Brandt,Marie Schrader," Skyler's sister and Hank's kleptomaniac wife. Brandt described Marie as ""an unpleasant bitch"", but also stated there was more to her than that. ""I think we're seeing more of it now that she would be there for her family. But it's all about her."""

Breaking Bad,8,Giancarlo Esposito,"Gustavo ""Gus"" Fring "," a Chilean high-level drug distributor who has a cover as an owner of the fast-food chain Los Pollos Hermanos. Esposito stated that for the third season, he incorporated his yoga training in his performance. Gus is the coolest cucumber that ever walked the Earth. I think about Eddie Olmos way back in Miami Vice. He was like dead – he was hardly breathing. I thought, how is this guy just standing in this fire and doing nothing? Gus has totally allowed me that level of flexibility and relaxation – not because he has ultimate power and he knows he can take someone's life. He's just confident."
Breaking Bad,9,Bob Odenkirk,Saul Goodman , a crooked strip mall lawyer who represents Walt and Jesse. Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer Robert Evans. I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to The Kid Stays in the Picture on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude in almost every line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. Then I go out and I do Saul.
Breaking Bad,10,Jonathan Banks,Mike Ehrmantraut ," works for Gus as an all-purpose cleaner and hitman, and also works for Saul as a private investigator. The character of Mike has been compared to Harvey Keitel's Winston Wolf character in Pulp Fiction, which Banks says he is not trying to emulate: ""I immediately tried to put it out of my mind, quite honestly. His cleaner ain't my cleaner. But throughout this world, you would suspect there had been a great many cleaners, whether government-run or individual contractors."""

He explained that everyone's goal has been to explore the difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identities—including his birth name, Kal-El, and his alter ego, Clark Kent. Cavill also stated that ""He's alone and there's no one like him,"" referring to Superman's vulnerabilities. ""That must be incredibly scary and lonely, not to know who you are or what you are, and trying to find out what makes sense. Where's your baseline? What do you draw from? Where do you draw a limit with the power you have? In itself, that's an incredible weakness."" In an interview with Total Film magazine, Cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5,000 calories a day, training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on the muscle mass. Tyler Hoechlin , Matthew Goode, Armie Hammer, Jamie Dornan, Joe Manganiello and Colin O'Donoghue were also considered for the role. Manganiello was subsequently cast as Deathstroke in Justice League. Cooper Timberline was cast as the 9-year-old Clark Kent, and Dylan Sprayberry was cast as the 13-year-old Clark Kent."
Man of Steel,3,Amy Adams,Lois Lane:  A reporter for the Daily Planet newspaper and the love interest of Clark Kent. Adams was selected from a list of actresses that included Kristen Stewart," Zoe Saldaña, Olivia Wilde, and Mila Kunis. ""There was a big, giant search for Lois,"" Snyder said. ""For us, it was a big thing and obviously a really important role. We did a lot of auditioning, but we had this meeting with Amy Adams and after that I just felt she was perfect for it."" Adams auditioned for the role three times: once for the unproduced Superman: Flyby, and the second time for Superman Returns before landing the current role. Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011. While announcing the role, Snyder said in a statement, ""We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today. Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful."" On portraying Lois Lane, Adams stated that the film would feature a Lois Lane who is an ""independent, feisty woman ... but set in a more identifiable world."" Adams said that ""She has become more of a free-ranging journalist, someone who likes to be hands-on. The nature of the newspaper business has changed so much. There is so much more pressure."""
Man of Steel,4,Michael Shannon,General Zod:  A Kryptonian general with the same superpowers as Superman," bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen and Daniel Day-Lewis were also considered for the role. Snyder stated, ""Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, but one of the most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role."" When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, ""The way  Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense."""
Man of Steel,5,Kevin Costner,"Jonathan Kent:   Clark's adoptive father. Snyder explained his reason for his casting the on-screen couple is solely for the realism: ""I think the thing you realize when you look at Diane and Kevin"," in our decision to cast them so far, you sort of get a sense of how tonally we're looking at the movie, and what you realize is that those guys are serious actors, and we're taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys. You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is, our first priority is to make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at."""
Man of Steel,6,Diane Lane,"Martha Kent:  Clark's adoptive mother. Lane was the first cast member to join the film after Cavill. ""This was a very important piece of casting for me because Martha Kent is the woman whose values helped shape the man we know as Superman",""" Snyder said in the release. ""We are thrilled to have Diane in the role because she can convey the wisdom and the wonder of a woman whose son has powers beyond her imagination."""
Man of Steel,7,Laurence Fishburne,"Perry White:  Editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet and the boss of Lois Lane. Fishburne is the first African-American to play Perry White in a live-action film. Fishburne remarked of his role: ""y inspiration really is the late Ed Bradley"," who was a CBS correspondent on 60 Minutes for many years ...  legendary Ed Bradley ... was a friend, a mentor, and a role model for me, particularly because he worked in journalism, and he was the kind of guy who walked with kings, but he had the common touch. And so he was my inspiration for Perry."""
Man of Steel,8,Antje Traue,Faora-Ul:  General Zod's sub-commander and a commander of the Kryptonian military," who is completely devoted and loyal to Zod. Gal Gadot was offered the role but declined because she was pregnant at that time; this allowed her to be later cast as Wonder Woman in the film's sequel. Alice Eve, Diane Kruger and Rosamund Pike were also considered for the role. About the role of Faora, Traue said in an interview: ""What I liked about her was that as a woman, we have certain doubts and we think too much sometimes about ourselves and all these things, they're not there for Faora. She's a bred warrior. So to really focus on that aspect, that fear is a chemical reaction and that it was bred out of her and she doesn't have it, it's liberating when you actually think about it. That you're just a one-track mind, there's no filter, there's no double meaning. She gets orders and she answers those orders without a question."""
Man of Steel,9,Ayelet Zurer,Lara Lor-Van:  Kal-El's biological mother and loyal wife to Jor-El. Julia Ormond had previously been announced as cast, but dropped out. Connie Nielsen was in negotiations for the role before Zurer was cast. Nielsen was subsequently cast as Queen Hippolyta in Wonder Woman.
Man of Steel,10,Christopher Meloni,Col. Nathan Hardy:  A United States Air Force officer," call sign ""Guardian"", assigned to the United States Northern Command."
Man of Steel,11,Russell Crowe,Jor-El:  A Kryptonian scientist who is Kal-El's biological father. Sean Penn and Clive Owen were also considered for the role. Crowe incorporates how his own fatherhood informed his reading of the script to portray Jor-El," stating that ""... it was one of those things where that's how it was connecting me. That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in."" Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: ""When I signed on ... well, one, I didn't realize that I would be wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well,"" Crowe said. ""But, I also didn't realize the type of organiser that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was really old-school prep. This is sort of David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated him. And I was on the movie for three and a half or four months before I even got in front of the camera."""

Pan's Labyrinth,1,Spanish: El laberinto del fauno,Directed by: Guillermo del Toro,Written by: Guillermo del Toro,"Produced by: Guillermo del Toro"","" Bertha Navarro"","" Alfonso Cuarón"","" Frida Torresblanco"","" Álvaro Augustin","Starring: Sergi López"","" Maribel Verdú"","" Ivana Baquero"","" Doug Jones"","" Ariadna Gil"","" Álex Angulo",Narrated by: Pablo Adán,Cinematography: Guillermo Navarro,Edited by: Bernat Vilaplana,Music by: Javier Navarrete,Productioncompanies: Productioncompanies,Distributed by: Warner Bros. Pictures,Release dates: Release dates,Running time: Running time,"Countries: Spain"","" Mexico[2]",Language: Spanish,Budget: $19 million[3],Box office: $83.9 million[3],Released: 19 December 2006,Genre: Genre,Label: Label,Producer: Producer
Pan's Labyrinth,2,Ivana Baquero,Ofelia / Princess Moanna," a child who comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the underworld. Del Toro said he was nervous about casting the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental.  ""The character I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in and she was a little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age."" Baquero says that Del Toro sent her many comics and fairy tales to help her ""get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt"". She says she thought the film was ""marvelous"", and that ""at the same time it can bring you pain, and sadness, and scariness, and happiness""."
Pan's Labyrinth,3,Sergi López,Captain Vidal," Ofelia's new stepfather and a Falange officer. Del Toro met with López in Barcelona, a year and a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. In parts of Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the Madrid-based producers told del Toro, ""You should be very careful because you don't know about these things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance""; del Toro replied ""Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care"". Of his character, López said: ""He is the most evil character I've ever played in my career. It is impossible to improve upon it; the character is so solid and so well written. Vidal is deranged, a psychopath who is impossible to defend. Even though his father's personality marked his existence—and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder—that cannot be an excuse. It would seem to be very cynical to use that to justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think it is great that the film does not consider any justification of fascism."""
Pan's Labyrinth,4,Maribel Verdú,Mercedes," Vidal's housekeeper. Del Toro selected Verdú to play the compassionate revolutionary because he ""saw a sadness in her which he thought would be perfect for the part""."
Pan's Labyrinth,5,Doug Jones,the Faun and the Pale Man. As the Faun," Jones guides Ofelia to the fantasy world. As the Pale Man, he plays a grotesque monster with an appetite for children. Jones had previously worked with del Toro on Mimic and Hellboy, and said the director sent him an email saying, ""You must be in this film. No one else can play this part but you."" Jones responded enthusiastically to an English translation of the script, but then found out the film was in Spanish, which he did not speak. Jones says he was ""terrified"" and del Toro suggested learning the script phonetically, but Jones rejected this, preferring to learn the words himself. He said, ""I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi-right before I even went in,"" using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up on to practice the words. Del Toro later decided to dub Jones with the voice of Pablo Adán, ""an authoritative theatre actor"", but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements. Jones's dual casting is intended to suggest that the Pale Man  is either a creation of the Faun or the Faun himself in another form."
Pan's Labyrinth,6,Ariadna Gil,Carmen / Queen of the Underworld, Ofelia's mother and Vidal's wife.
Pan's Labyrinth,7,Álex Angulo,Doctor Ferreiro," a doctor in the service of Vidal, but an anti-Francoist."

BoJack Horseman,2,Will Arnett,BoJack Horseman," a self-loathing cynical alcoholic horse currently in his 50s, whose acting career peaked when he starred in a successful 1990s family sitcom called Horsin' Around. Though he began as a young bright-eyed actor, he has since grown bitter, deeply depressed, and jaded towards Hollywoo and who he has become post-fame. BoJack has been shown to be caring and insightful, but his insecurities, loneliness, desperate need for approval, and guilt over his own actions often result in self-destructive and selfish actions that devastate those around him. His past and present relationships with his abusive alcoholic parents and his attempts at overcoming their legacy are a continual theme of the series. BoJack also discovers he has a more sensible half-sister, Hollyhock, a result of an affair by his father."
BoJack Horseman,3,Amy Sedaris,Princess Carolyn," a pink Persian cat who is BoJack's agent in the first three seasons and former on-and-off girlfriend. Hailing from Eden, North Carolina, the earnest and unflagging Princess Carolyn was a top agent at Vigor agency through her tireless pursuit of new talent and large network of odd personal connections. Though she struggles to find a balance between work, her troubled personal life, and taking care of BoJack and her friends, she enjoys her fast-paced hectic lifestyle. She left Vigor to start a new agency with her then-boyfriend and coworker Rutabaga Rabitowitz. After recognizing his lack of trustworthiness and confronting her fear of being alone, she ultimately decides to leave him and run the new company named VIM by herself. After several setbacks, Princess Carolyn closes VIM in season 3, only to reopen it as a management agency. She struggles throughout the series in starting a family and suffers several miscarriages. In season 5, after several failed attempts, she successfully adopts a baby porcupine from Sadie, a young woman from her hometown. In the series finale, she marries Judah, her loyal assistant."
BoJack Horseman,4,Alison Brie,Diane Nguyen," a human ghostwriter, a well-schooled, misunderstood intellectual, and a Vietnamese-American third-wave feminist from Boston. She is a thinker who wants to make the world a better place for women and wants others to behave according to her morals even though she often breaks them. While writing BoJack's memoir, Diane and BoJack develop a strong friendship that initially becomes awkward and strained after BoJack develops romantic feelings for her, especially as she was dating Mr. Peanutbutter at the time. She eventually marries Mr. Peanutbutter, but during and after Mr. Peanutbutter's run for Governor of California, their marriage begins to deteriorate, and they divorce at the beginning of season 5. She eventually realizes she has depression, and gains weight as her mental health improves due to antidepressants; news media celebrated the series' realistic portrayal of her changing body shape as a sign of improved health. During the sixth season, Diane develops a relationship with a buffalo named Guy  and comes to terms with her neglectful upbringing. She is a graduate of Boston University."
BoJack Horseman,5,Paul F. Tompkins,Mr. Peanutbutter," an energetic, optimistic and cheerful yellow Labrador Retriever who is BoJack's former sitcom rival. Mr. Peanutbutter was the star of Mr. Peanutbutter's House, which, according to BoJack, ""borrowed the premise"" from Horsin' Around. Despite their rivalry, Mr. Peanutbutter cares a great deal about BoJack's opinion and admires him for his work on Horsin' Around. He has an especially good relationship with Todd, and his positive attitude and financial resources combined with Todd's outlandish schemes and plans often result in the two starting questionable business ventures. Mr. Peanutbutter has been married three times . In ""Old Acquaintance"", it is revealed that ""Mr."" is his actual first name. He is a graduate of Northwestern University and a native of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. His character was initially created as a foil for BoJack, but then evolves into an important character himself."
BoJack Horseman,6,Aaron Paul,Todd Chavez," an unemployed, silly but vastly talented 24-year-old human slacker who ended up at BoJack's house for a party five years before the beginning of the series and never left. Although BoJack constantly voices disdain for him, he secretly cares about Todd, continuing to financially support him and sabotage his attempts to gain independence. Todd has been shown to possess a plethora of skills including an understanding of Japanese, entrepreneurial know-how—allying with Mr. Peanutbutter for various business ideas—and writing and composing his own rock opera, which was eventually sabotaged by BoJack. This, along with other examples of BoJack's poor behavior towards him leads Todd to break ties with BoJack in season 4. Todd also has an uncanny knack for getting himself in absurd and extremely dangerous situations when his friends aren't around, such as getting into gun fights on several occasions, ending up in prison, and in one case, switching places Prince and the Pauper–style with a Cordovian dictator. He is also almost never seen without wearing his signature yellow beanie. In his teenage years, he was an aimless skateboarder, and the object of affection of his schoolmate Emily. He realizes in the season 3 finale ""That Went Well"" that he is asexual. In season 6, Todd forms a relationship with a rabbit named Maude who is also asexual."

Pictures,Release dates: Release dates,Running time: Running time,Country: United States[2],Language: English,Budget: $180–200 million[3],Box office: $411 million[4]
Pacific Rim,2,Charlie Hunnam,Raleigh Becket:  A washed-up former pilot called out of retirement by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam," del Toro stated, ""I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And he was the kind of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I would like to have a few beers with that guy' ... he has an earthy quality."" Describing the character, Hunnam stated, ""When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me out of retirement to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is."" Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child."
Pacific Rim,3,Idris Elba,Marshal Stacker Pentecost:  Raleigh's commanding officer in Pan Pacific Defense Corps and former Jaeger pilot dying of radiation poisoning due to lax radiation shielding on the first Jaeger models. On selecting Elba," del Toro stated, ""This is a movie where I have had to deal with more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?"" In another interview, the director said: ""I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows . I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel the weight of the world on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character ... Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity ... Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that."" To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts."
Pacific Rim,4,Rinko Kikuchi,Mako Mori:  Raleigh's co-pilot who lost her family in a Kaiju attack and was adopted by Pentecost. Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju," Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro explained, ""I was very careful how I built the movie. One of the other things I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's not going to be a sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character."" Noting that the other actors were exhausted and ""destroyed physically"" by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: ""The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained ... I asked Rinko her secret and she said 'I think of gummi bears and flowers.' I try to do that in my life now."" Mana Ashida plays Mako as a child."
Pacific Rim,5,Charlie Day,Dr. Newton 'Newt' Geiszler:  A scientist studying the Kaiju. Day stated," ""Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide a little bit of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real ... the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant."" Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a ""big personality"". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: ""He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both."" Trek Buccino portrays Newt as a child."
Pacific Rim,6,Ron Perlman,Hannibal Chau:  A black marketeer who makes a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated," ""I actually think this character was designed to be played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way,  had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character ... I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona ... which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down."" Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated, ""I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story ... That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, you can make your own story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience."" The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Sichuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character."
Pacific Rim,7,Robert Kazinsky,Chuck Hansen:   An Australian Jaeger pilot considered the finest soldier left in the Resistance. He and his father Herc pilot Striker Eureka," ""the strongest and the fastest"" Jaeger with eleven Kaiju kills, and make up the Resistance's ""go-to team"". Kazinsky, a fan of science-fiction, was initially drawn by the film's concept, ""My immediate reaction was 'Holy crap, that's cool.' In the hands of somebody else, you might sit there and go, 'Well, this might be terrible,' but with del Toro doing it, you kind of go, 'This is going to be amazing.'"". Reflecting on his experience in the film, Kazinsky said in an interview, ""The most fun I have ever had in my entire life was Pacific Rim, playing Chuck was incredibly fun."""
Pacific Rim,8,Max Martini,"Hercules ""Herc"" Hansen:  Chuck's father and co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated the fact that he was cast as Chuck's father"," being only 13 years Kazinsky's senior. However, Kazinsky said they developed a bond while filming, ""Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had ... The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend."" Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, ""The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog."" The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh ""might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0""."
Pacific Rim,9,Clifton Collins Jr.,"Tendo Choi:  A Jaeger technician of Chinese and South American descent. Collins described his character as the ""brains"" behind the Jaegers.",
Pacific Rim,10,Burn Gorman,Dr. Hermann Gottlieb:  A scientist studying the Kaiju alongside Geiszler. According to del Toro," Gottlieb is a ""tweed-wearing, English, phlegmatic introvert that never leaves the lab"". The modest Gottlieb resents Geiszler's arrogance and radical behavior; the duo echo the film's theme of incompatible people functioning together when the time comes. Drew Adkins portrays Gottlieb as a child."
Pacific Rim,11,Diego Klattenhoff,Yancy Becket:  Raleigh's older brother and co-pilot. Klattenhoff joined the project to work with del Toro. Describing his character," Klattentoff said, ""This is a guy who is looking out for his very eager, younger brother and they were enabled with this gift that gave them the opportunity to kind of save the world. Or help, at least."" Tyler Stevenson plays Yancy as a child."

2 Broke Girls,2,Kat Dennings,"Maxine ""Max"" George Black"," one of the waitresses at the Williamsburg Diner. She is a poor working-class girl who had a rough childhood in Hope, Rhode Island, and an equally rough adult life, driven by both poverty and being raised by a mother who was usually absent and dangerously incompetent when she was around . Han initially allowed her to sell homemade cupcakes in the diner, which led to her going forward with Caroline's idea to go into the cupcake business. Max is street-smart, tends to deliver insults with a smile, and often pokes fun at her own promiscuous behavior, voluptuous breasts, and marijuana indulgence. She always wears knee-high brown leather boots and a name tag while waitressing. She is co-godmothers with Caroline to Barbara Kaczyński-Golishevsky."
2 Broke Girls,3,Beth Behrs,Caroline Wesbox Channing," a waitress at the Williamsburg Diner. She is a skinny, blonde, formerly rich high-society girl and University of Pennsylvania Wharton graduate who lost all of her money when her father was arrested and thrown in jail for a Ponzi scheme. She is forced to start over and becomes Max's co-worker, roommate, and eventual best friend. She comes up with the idea of starting a cupcake business with Max. Despite being spoiled since birth and then losing her money, Caroline is kind and optimistic, though high-maintenance at times. She is sometimes very clueless. Caroline always wears large pearl necklaces with her waitress uniform, as well as high-heeled shoes and a metal, silver hook around her waist. Unlike Max, she does not wear a name tag with her waitress uniform. She is co-godmothers with Max to Barbara Kaczyński-Golishevesky."

2 Broke Girls,5,Jonathan Kite,Vanko Oleg Golishevsky," a Ukrainian cook at the Williamsburg Diner. He sexually harasses Max and Caroline constantly with inappropriate jokes, innuendo, and propositions for sex, but his behavior is benign and easily ignored .

At the end of season two, Oleg cheated on Sophie, leading her to angrily break up with him off-screen before the third-season premiere. In season four, the two reconcile and get engaged and then married. In the sixth-season premiere, they have a baby daughter named Barbara Kaczyński-Golishevsky."

She always sits in a booth that she considers her own. She was involved in a relationship with Oleg during seasons two and three, gets engaged to him in season four, marries him in the finale, and during season five becomes pregnant with their first child.

At the end of the season, Max goes back to Peach and gets him back. In season two, the girls enlist the help of two Amish boys to convert the garden into a barn",a permanent home for Chestnut.

Firefly,2,Nathan Fillion,"Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds – the owner and captain of Serenity and former Independent sergeant in the pivotal Battle of Serenity Valley. Malcolm grew up on a ranch and was raised by his mother and the ranch hands. In the Unification War"," he fought as a platoon sergeant in the 57th Overlanders of the Independent Army, the ""Browncoats"". He is cunning, a capable leader, and a skilled fighter. Mal's primary motivation is his will for independence. While he is not above petty theft, smuggling, or even killing to maintain his free lifestyle, he is generally honest in his dealings with others, fiercely loyal to his crew, and closely follows a personal moral code. He is openly antagonistic toward religion as a result of his war experience."
Firefly,3,Gina Torres,Zoe Alleyne Washburne – second-in-command onboard Serenity," a loyal wartime friend of Captain Reynolds and Wash's wife. Her surname during the Unification War was Alleyne. She was born and raised on a ship and served under Mal during the war as a corporal. Described by her husband as a ""warrior woman"", she is a capable fighter who keeps calm even in the most dangerous situations. She demonstrates an almost unconditional loyalty to Mal. The only exception noted being her marriage to Wash, which the captain claims was against his orders."
Firefly,4,Alan Tudyk,"Hoban ""Wash"" Washburne – Serenity's pilot and Zoe's husband. Deeply in love with his wife"," Wash expresses jealousy over his wife's ""war buddy"" relationship and unconditional support of their captain, most particularly in the episode ""War Stories"", in which he confronts Mal, even as a dissatisfied customer is torturing them. He joined pilot training just to see the stars, which were invisible from the surface of his polluted homeworld, and he joined Serenity despite being highly sought after by other ships. He is light-hearted and tends to make amusing comments, despite the severity of any situation."
Firefly,5,Morena Baccarin,Inara Serra – a Companion," which is the 26th century cross between a geisha and a courtesan or mistress, who rents one of Serenity's two small shuttles. Inara enjoys high social standing. Her presence confers a degree of legitimacy and social acceptance the crew of Serenity would not have without her on board. Inara displays great dignity, civility, and compassion. There is strong romantic tension between her and Mal, who share many character traits, but each jokingly objects to the other's work as ""whoring"" or ""petty theft"", respectively. Both refuse to act on their feelings and try to keep their relationship professional."
Firefly,6,Adam Baldwin,Jayne Cobb – a mercenary. He and Mal met when they were on opposite sides of a dispute; Mal," while held at gunpoint, offered Jayne his own bunk and a higher cut than his current employer, so Jayne switched sides and shot his then-partners. In the original pilot, ""Serenity"", he intimates to Mal that he did not betray him because ""The money wasn't good enough.""  However, previously he had pointedly asked the Alliance agent whether he would be required to turn on the captain to help him. In ""Ariel"", he defends his actions in alerting the authorities regarding Simon and River by claiming he had not intended to betray Mal. He is someone who can be depended on in a fight. He tends to act like a ""lummox"" who thinks he is the smartest person in space, but occasional hints of intelligence peek through this façade, giving the impression that he acts dumber than he is. As Whedon states several times, Jayne is the man who will ask the questions that no one else wants to. Even though he is a macho character, he has shown a particularly intense fear of Reavers, more so than the rest of the crew. Despite his amoral mercenary persona, he sends a significant portion of his income to his mother, again suggesting that there is more to his character than what he presents to the rest of the crew."
Firefly,7,Jewel Staite,"Kaywinnet Lee ""Kaylee"" Frye – the ship's mechanic. In the episode ""Out of Gas"""," it is established that she has no formal training, but keeps Serenity running with an intuitive gift for the workings of mechanical equipment. Jewel Staite explains Kaylee's character as being wholesome, sweet, and ""completely genuine in that sweetness"", adding ""She loves being on that ship. She loves all of those people. And she is the only one who loves all of them incredibly genuinely."" She has a crush on Simon Tam. Kaylee is the heart of the ship: according to creator Joss Whedon, if Kaylee believes something, it is true."
Firefly,8,Sean Maher,Simon Tam – a trauma surgeon of the first caliber ," who is on the run after breaking his sister River out of a government research facility. In the episode ""Safe"", it is revealed that he and River had a privileged upbringing with access to the best education. In rescuing River over his stern father's severe objections, Simon sacrificed a highly successful future in medicine. His bumbling attempts at a romantic relationship with Kaylee are a recurring subplot throughout the series. At every turn, he seems to find a way to foil his attempts at romance unwittingly. His life is defined by caring for his sister."
Firefly,9,Summer Glau,River Tam – smuggled onto the ship by her brother. She is a brilliant," compassionate, and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne frequently requests that River and Simon be taken off the ship."
Firefly,10,Ron Glass,Derrial Book – a Shepherd . Although presented as a devout Christian," Book has profound, unexplained knowledge about criminal activities, police corruption, and military strategy, tactics, and weapons. In ""Safe"", he was shown to have sufficient status in the Alliance to receive emergency medical treatment from an Alliance ship, with no questions asked. He is also proficient in hand-to-hand combat and the use of firearms. While objecting to violence most of the time, on a rescue mission, he joins the fight, stating that while the Bible is quite specific about killing, it is ""somewhat fuzzier on the subject of kneecaps"". Book is a moral guide for Mal and the rest of the crew, a voice of reason, conscience, and spirituality. At the same time, he seems to get along well with the amoral mercenary Jayne, with the two spotting each other while working out using a bench press. His hidden backstory would have been gradually revealed had the series continued but was instead explored in the 2010 comic book The Shepherd's Tale."
Firefly,11,Mark Sheppard,"Badger – an established smuggling middleman on the planet Persephone. He provided jobs for Serenity on at least two occasions. In the DVD commentary for the episode ""Serenity"""," it was revealed that this part was initially written with Whedon himself playing the role. Badger appeared in the original pilot ""Serenity"" and in ""Shindig"", with a return in the comic book series Serenity: Those Left Behind."
Firefly,12,Michael Fairman,Adelai Niska – a criminal kingpin who has a reputation for violent reprisals," including severe, prolonged torture, against those who fail him or even irritate him. He appeared in ""The Train Job"" and ""War Stories""."
Firefly,13,Christina Hendricks,"""Saffron"" – a con artist whose real name is unknown. She first appeared in the episode ""Our Mrs. Reynolds"" as Mal's involuntarily acquired wife. She has a habit of marrying her marks during her scams. She returns in the episode ""Trash"""," where Mal jokingly addresses her as ""YoSaffBridge"", from the three of her aliases known within the show: ""Yolanda"", ""Saffron"", and ""Bridget""."
Firefly,14,Jeff Ricketts and Dennis Cockrum,"""The Hands of Blue"" – two anonymous men wearing suits and blue gloves who pursue River"," apparently to return her to the institute from which she escaped, as shown in ""The Train Job"", ""Ariel"", and the Serenity: Those Left Behind comic. They kill anyone, including Alliance personnel, who had contact with her, using a mysterious hand-held device that causes fatal hemorrhaging in anyone at whom it is aimed. River, during anxiety attacks or psychological meltdowns, has repeated the phrase ""Two by two/hands of blue"" in a way that resembles poetic meter. This suggests that River has had close experience with them."

It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,2,Charlie Day,Charlie Kelly," co-owner and janitor of Paddy's Pub. He is a childhood friend of Mac, and high school friend of Dennis and Dee. He lives in squalor with Frank in a run-down, vermin-infested apartment, and has deep-seated psychological problems, partly due to substance abuse from huffing paint and glue, and partly due to his complicated family background possibly involving child abuse. He has an extensive history of pica and regularly eats various items not meant for human consumption, such as cat food, stickers, paint, and bleach. Due to his general lack of intelligence and his illiteracy, he is arguably the simplest member of The Gang. Despite this, Charlie is a naturally gifted musician, a self-proclaimed expert in ""bird law"" and possibly the only competent worker at Paddy's with his knack for unorthodox maintenance practices . He also has an unhealthy obsession with ""The Waitress"", a recurring character who finds his interest in her creepy."
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,3,Glenn Howerton,Dennis Reynolds," co-owner and the main bartender of Paddy's Pub, in addition to being Dee's twin brother and Frank's son. Originally the most intelligent and normal-seeming of the three co-owners, Dennis is slowly revealed to be the most narcissistic and psychopathic of The Gang. Dennis is extremely superficial, selfish, vain and abrasive. His predatory nature is often depicted through numerous attempts to seduce various women; which, when successful, result in him gaslighting and emotionally abusing them in order to win over their favor before inevitably dumping them once he has had sex with them . It is strongly hinted at times that Dennis may secretly be a serial killer, though this remains ambiguous as a running gag. In season 10, he is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, though he frequently denies this and believes himself to be completely rational, and is convinced that he is in complete control of everything and everyone around him, going as far as to label himself a 'golden god'. In the season 12 finale, Dennis reveals to the rest of the gang that he has an infant son, and moves to North Dakota to raise him. He returns to Philadelphia in season 13, supposedly supporting his family from a distance."
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,4,Rob McElhenney,"Ronald ""Mac"" McDonald"," co-owner and self-proclaimed bouncer of Paddy's Pub. He is Charlie's childhood friend and Dennis's high school friend. The son of a convicted felon who has been in prison for much of Mac's life, he frequently attempts to demonstrate his toughness and refers to himself as the ""sheriff of Paddy's"". Deeply insecure, Mac constantly seeks the approval of those around him, especially his father, his apathetic and emotionally absent mother, and Dennis, his roommate. He suffers from extreme bouts of body dysmorphia, and has been depicted at various weights throughout the course of the series: prior to the beginning of Season 7, he gained 60 pounds  and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, and when he finally returned to a healthy weight in the following season, he admitted he misses being fat, as he believed he had come across as ""scary"" to people. In Season 13, he is noticeably fit and physically stronger, though it is quickly revealed his motives for attaining his shape was strictly due to his intense desire for acceptance from the rest of the Gang. He often brags about his hand-to-hand combat skills, but typically flees from physical confrontation and is usually depicted as the most cowardly of the gang. Mac is a Roman Catholic, though he often espouses strong Christian fundamentalist opinions, despite his often amoral behavior, such as casual sex with numerous women, including Dennis's and Dee's mother. Though it is frequently insinuated Mac harbors homosexual feelings, he maintained an adamant denial of any such proclivity, much to the gang's annoyance, until he comes out in season 12. Later episodes reveal that Mac is sexually attracted to his best friend, Dennis."
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,5,Kaitlin Olson,"Deandra ""Sweet Dee"" Reynolds"," waitress and sometimes bartender at Paddy's Pub, as well as Dennis's twin sister and Frank's daughter. Though initially depicted as The Gang's 'the voice of reason' in the debut season, she gradually loses any sense of moral fortitude that she once had, and is frequently shown to be just as prejudiced and depraved as her male friends by the end of season 1, arguably becoming the most petty member of the group, often plotting against others whom she deems more successful than herself in a vain effort to boost her own image. Dee wore a back brace in high school, leaving her with the nickname ""The Aluminum Monster"", and she is frequently referred to by the gang as a bird. Dee lives alone in an apartment. Though often the butt of the gang's jokes, she frequently involves herself in their schemes, perhaps due to her constant need for approval and attention from her peers. She does not hold any ownership stake in the bar - perhaps due to the gang's various prejudices against her, but also in part to her desire to become a professional actress/comedian . In multiple episodes, it is referenced that Dee set her college roommate on fire, and is often portrayed as the most physically violent of the group. Despite expressing outward disgust at her brother's more predatory behavior, later episodes reveal Dee not to be above such behavior herself."
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,6,Danny DeVito,Frank Reynolds," father of Dennis and Dee Reynolds, and the majority owner of Paddy's Pub soon after his introduction in season 2 onward. Frank is a millionaire and often funds and enables The Gang's worst schemes and impulses, just to feel a sense of youthfulness and energy. He was once a successful businessman with a long history of illegal operations and dealings with sordid characters, but chooses to abandon that life and redeem himself after leaving his ""whore wife"", Barbara Reynolds. It is revealed at the end of season 2 that Dennis and Dee are products of an affair and not actually his biological children. He has since embraced his ""feral"" nature and describes himself as ""fringe class"". Despite his substantial financial resources, he chooses to share a decrepit studio apartment with Charlie, where they sleep together on a pullout couch and have a surprisingly affectionate pseudo-father/son relationship. The two have similar interests, such as playing the inexplicable game of Night Crawlers and foraging naked in sewers for valuables. He always arms himself with at least one loaded handgun and does not hesitate to brandish or even discharge one when provoked, and often snorts cocaine as part of his daily routine."

Les Misérables,2,Hugh Jackman,Jean Valjean," a Frenchman released from Toulon prison after 19 years of imprisonment for stealing bread and attempting to escape the prison. Around June 2011, Jackman met with producer Cameron Mackintosh to audition in New York. To prepare for the role, Jackman lost 15 pounds  and later regained 30 pounds  to mirror his character's success. He avoided drinking coffee, warmed up at least 15 minutes every day, kept Ricola lozenges, drank as much as seven litres of water per day, sat in steam three times a day, took cold baths and used a wet washcloth over his face while flying, citing the musical's original co-director Trevor Nunn for his training. He worked extensively with vocal coach Joan Lader, and managed to extend his vocal range, which he originally categorised a high baritone, up to tenor."

I think it had something to do with Tom's passion for what he was about to undertake, and he clearly understood the problems and he clearly understood the challenge."" On visiting Victor Hugo's home in Paris, Crowe said, "" told me about  Vidocq, a man who had been both a prisoner and a policeman, the man credited with inventing undercover police work when he established the Brigade de Surete."""
Les Misérables,4,Anne Hathaway,Fantine," the mother of Cosette and a struggling factory worker, who resorts to prostitution to send money to her daughter. When Hathaway was cast, she stated, ""There was resistance because I was between their ideal ages for the parts—maybe not mature enough for Fantine but past the point where I could believably play Cosette."""
Les Misérables,5,Amanda Seyfried,Cosette," the illegitimate daughter of Fantine, who is kept by the Thénardiers until Valjean buys her from them. On developing Cosette, Seyfried said, ""In the little time that I had to explain Cosette and give the audience a reason  a symbol of love and strength and light in this tragedy, I needed to be able to convey things you may not have connected with in the show."" A vocal coach was enlisted to help her with the songs. Isabelle Allen plays Cosette as a child. On working with her fellow actors, Allen said, ""They gave us lots of tips and mostly  sure we were all OK. They were really nice."""
Les Misérables,6,Eddie Redmayne,Marius Pontmercy," a student revolutionary who is friends with the Thenardiers' daughter, Éponine, but falls in love with Cosette. He found director Hooper's vision ""incredibly helpful"". On collaborating with Hooper, Redmayne said, ""He was incredibly collaborative. Certainly during the rehearsal process, we sat with Tom and the Victor Hugo book adding things."" It was Redmayne who suggested to Hooper that his character's song, ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"", should begin a cappella in order to better express Marius' guilt and pain."
Les Misérables,7,Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen,the Thénardiers," a pair of swindling innkeepers. Hooper previously collaborated with Bonham Carter in The King's Speech, in which she portrayed Queen Elizabeth, King George VI's wife. Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter previously co-starred in the film adaptation of the musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. When Baron Cohen accepted the role of Thénardier, he had to abandon Django Unchained."
Les Misérables,8,Samantha Barks,Éponine," the Thénardiers' daughter. Having previously played the role at the 25th Anniversary concert and in the West End production, Barks said ""there was similarities in playing the role—they're the same character—but Éponine in the novel and Éponine in the musical are two kind of different girls, so to me it was the thrill of merging those two together, to get something that still had that heart and soul that we all connect to in the musical, but also the awkward, self-loathing teenager that we see in the novel, trying to merge those two together."" She found Jackman ""fascinating to learn from, and I feel like that's the way it should be done"". Natalya Wallace plays a young Éponine."
Les Misérables,9,Aaron Tveit,Enjolras," the leader of Les Amis de l'ABC. Hoping to play Marius, Tveit submitted an audition tape in which he sang  ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" and ""In My Life"". He had never performed any role in the musical. He also said of Enjolras that ""once I got more and more familiar with the material and when I read the novel, I was like, 'Wow this is a really, really great role,' and I felt very much better suited for it."" Tveit said the shooting of the film was ""almost as grueling as a marathon""."
Les Misérables,10,Daniel Huttlestone,Gavroche," the wise and heroic street urchin, who displays a fresh, lucid and ironic look at contemporary French society. He had performed the same role at the Queen's Theatre in London, staying with them for a year before being cast to reprise Gavroche in the film adaptation. His performance was praised both by public and critics, some of whom viewed him as a scene-stealer."

Community,2,Joel McHale,Jeff Winger," a former lawyer who enrolls at Greendale after being suspended by the state bar for falsely claiming to have a bachelor's degree. Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident, narcissist lothario who constantly manipulates people to get what he wants, which is often to not do any work. He first created the study group to date Britta. Britta needed help studying and Jeff pretended to be a board-certified Spanish tutor. But as he becomes closer to his new study group, some of his habits and views change. Most of the group  tends to idolize Jeff for his charisma, and often seeks advice from him. Although he initially dislikes his role as the group's straight man and tries to appear indifferent to their concerns before grudgingly helping them, Jeff is more willing to make personal sacrifices for his friends over time and selectively reveals that he can be more patient and less critical than what other ""alpha males"" typically offer."
Community,3,Gillian Jacobs,Britta Perry," an anarchist, atheist, and activist who traveled around the world after dropping out of high school. Britta tries to seem proactive, intelligent, and mature, but often comes off as pretentious and hypocritical, especially when she decides to become a psychologist starting in season 3. This leads the other group members to see her as a bad influence on the group, as evidenced by her taste in mentally damaged men, and her tendency to make things go wrong. Despite not being as worldly or well-informed an activist as she thinks, Britta has a genuine and powerful desire to help others, and significant enthusiasm and energy for what she puts effort into ."
Community,4,Danny Pudi,Abed Nadir," a film student of Palestinian and Polish descent, with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via conventional means due to his implied autism, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film and TV clichés. Despite being out-of-touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behavior and often the wisest member of the group. These eccentricities allow him to pick up on flaws the other characters have and tend to bluntly point them out, eventually resulting in the characters learning from his insights. Harmon based the character on Abed Gheith, whom he met through Channel 101."
Community,5,Yvette Nicole Brown,Shirley Bennett ," a divorced mother and vocal Christian going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is a kind-hearted person with strong morals, but can be overbearing and often resorts to using guilt in her interactions with her friends. Though soft-spoken, Shirley has a quick temper, a characteristic that manifests when she is advocating for herself or her friends. It is often implied that Shirley's Christian beliefs, which she tends to impose on most non-Christians around her, are a means of coping with her anger issues and to repress the stress she deals with in raising her family while also dealing with school."
Community,6,Alison Brie,Annie Edison," the youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever, relentlessly organized and comparatively innocent. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted to Adderall, which has caused her to be very anxious and desperate to prove herself in a variety of extra-curricular groups despite already being considered naturally intelligent and attractive by others. Though normally kind-hearted, she can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve or is denied something she strongly cares about. However, her friendship with Jeff, as well as her living situation with Troy and Abed, slowly allow her to become more laid-back and genial."
Community,7,Donald Glover,Troy Barnes ," a former high school star quarterback who lost his scholarship to a top-tier university when he separated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he actually did on purpose in order to escape the pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy starts the series trying to appear cool and acting like a bully and a stereotypical football player, but he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his nerdy and carefree side, particularly in him becoming best friends with Abed. Troy generally struggles with the idea of becoming older, often looking to Jeff and Pierce for guidance, despite already showing signs of being capable of leadership and connecting the group together."
Community,8,Ken Jeong,Ben Chang," an unstable Spanish teacher at Greendale. Chang often takes extreme action against his students, usually yelling at them for the slightest infraction or fervently using his superior status to taunt them. He has alternately been a friend and foe of the study group, his ultimate desire being to fit in with them, though his behavior makes them desperate to not include him. After Annie gets him fired at the end of season 1, Chang alternates between a variety of roles, becoming a student in season 2, a security guard in season 3, as Kevin who is suffering from ""Changnesia""  during season 4, a math teacher under work release in season 5, and a member of the Save Greendale Committee in season 6."
Community,9,Chevy Chase,Pierce Hawthorne ," a millionaire and CEO of the Hawthorne Wipes moist towelette company who enrolled at Greendale a decade prior to the start of the series out of boredom and a passive attempt at self-discovery. More than anyone else within the study group, Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the group because of his arrogance, lack of empathy, and casual ignorance of politically correct behavior, all of which largely stem from his old age and his emotionally abusive father. This includes believing Britta is a closeted lesbian, mispronouncing Abed's name, and lusting over Shirley. He also tends to envy the other group members, particularly Jeff's relative youthful attractiveness and Abed's close friendship with Troy. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, showing that he does care for each of the group members."
Community,10,Jim Rash,Craig Pelton ," the dean of Greendale, who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university and goes to extreme lengths to try to make it fun and politically correct, while frequently explaining his many unresolved business decisions. A man of unclear sexual orientation, he frequently attempts to flirt with Jeff and is an increasingly avid cross-dresser. In season 6, he identifies himself as gay, though he views it as an insufficient label. The study group is by far the Dean's favorite group of students, and he is constantly making up excuses to come talk to them, often by walking into their study room unannounced while wearing a costume in order to tell them about events going on in the school."

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,1,Directed by: Michel Gondry,Screenplay by: Charlie Kaufman,"Story by: Charlie Kaufman"","" Michel Gondry"","" Pierre Bismuth","Produced by: Steve Golin"","" Anthony Bregman","Starring: Jim Carrey"","" Kate Winslet"","" Kirsten Dunst"","" Mark Ruffalo"","" Elijah Wood"","" Tom Wilkinson",Cinematography: Ellen Kuras,Edited by: Valdís Óskarsdóttir,Music by: Jon Brion,Productioncompanies: Productioncompanies,Distributed by: Focus Features,Release date: Release date,Running time: Running time,Country: United States,Language: English,Budget: $20 million[1],Box office: $74 million[1]
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,2,Jim Carrey,Joel Barish: A bookish introvert who enters a two-year relationship with Clementine Kruczynski. After their relationship ends," Clementine erases Joel from her memory, and he erases her from his mind in response. Charlie Kaufman depicted Joel with some of his autobiographical personality traits. Producers cast Carrey against type for his role as Joel, selecting him for his everyday appearance, as well as his comedic ability. According to Gondry, this was because ""It's hard to be funny. It's far easier to take someone really funny and bring them down than do the opposite."" To induce Carrey, an actor who typically portrayed high-energy roles, to portray a restrained character, Gondry would not allow him to improvise, a restriction he did not place on the other cast members . Gondry also put Carrey off balance by giving misleading orders or by rolling the camera at the wrong time. Gondry believed this would make Carrey forget what he should do to be Joel, allowing him to go in character. In the 2017 Netflix documentary Jim & Andy, Carrey mentions a conversation with Gondry one year before shooting began for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, shortly after Carrey had a breakup with an unspecified woman. Gondry saw that Carrey's emotional state at the time was ""so beautiful, so broken"" that he asked him to stay that way for one year to fit the character. In the documentary, Carrey commented, ""That's how fucked up this business is."" Nicolas Cage was Gondry's original choice to play Joel, but Cage was unavailable as he was in high demand from independent directors after his performance in Leaving Las Vegas."
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,3,Kate Winslet,Clementine Kruczynski: A spontaneous extrovert who," after breaking up with him after a two-year relationship, erases Joel Barish from her mind. Producers cast Winslet against type for her part as Clementine, as Winslet had previously featured heavily in period pieces. She received the role after she was the only actress to offer criticism on the script instead of pandering to the writers. After another actress won an Oscar, the studio attempted to make Gondry use her instead of Winslet for the role of Clementine, but Gondry threatened to walk from the project if that occurred. During filming, Gondry took Winslet to a separate room to coach her, and she wore wigs instead of dying her hair. Some commentators note how Clementine's character criticizes the Manic Pixie Dream Girl stock character several years before film critic Nathan Rabin coined the phrase. Most commentators discuss one particular example to demonstrate this criticism, wherein Clementine warns Joel she is flawed: ""Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours."" With her impulsiveness, emotional intensity , alcohol dependence, turbulent relationships, reckless behavior, and hasty idealization or devaluation of Joel, Clementine seems to exhibit traits of borderline personality disorder, although it is not clear whether Kaufman wrote her character with this specific diagnosis in mind. Gondry had earlier thought of casting Björk for the role of Clementine. She feared she would be emotionally affected and rejected the invitation after reading the script."
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,4,Kirsten Dunst,Mary Svevo: The receptionist for Lacuna who," while dating Stan Fink, has a crush on Howard Mierzwiak. While erasing Joel's memory, Howard's wife catches her kissing Howard. Howard's wife reveals Mary previously had a relationship with Howard, which Howard erased from her mind. She reacts to this information by quitting her job and mailing Lacuna's company records to its customers. In the script, Mary and Howard's relationship resulted in an unplanned pregnancy, leading to Howard pressuring Mary into an abortion, which Howard also erased from her memory."
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,5,Mark Ruffalo,"Stan Fink: A technician for Lacuna who is in a relationship with Mary Svevo until the reveal of her previous relationship with Howard Mierzwiak.
